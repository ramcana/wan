    bottlenecks = []

    # Slow operations detection
    slow_ops = [m for m in metrics if m.duration_seconds > 30]
    if len(slow_ops) > len(metrics) * 0.1:
        bottlenecks.append("High number of slow operations detected")

    # Resource constraint detection
    high_cpu = [s for s in resource_history if s.cpu_percent > 80]
    if len(high_cpu) > len(resource_history) * 0.2:
        bottlenecks.append("High CPU usage detected")

    return bottlenecks
```

### 2. Optimization Recommendations

**Intelligent Suggestions:**

- Download optimization (parallel downloads, bandwidth management)
- Health check optimization (caching, frequency reduction)
- Resource optimization (memory cleanup, disk space management)
- Fallback strategy improvements (better algorithms, caching)

**Recommendation Engine:**

```python
def _generate_recommendations(self, metrics, resource_history, bottlenecks):
    recommendations = []

    # Download-specific recommendations
    download_metrics = [m for m in metrics if m.metric_type == DOWNLOAD_OPERATION]
    if download_metrics:
        avg_time = sum(m.duration_seconds for m in download_metrics) / len(download_metrics)
        if avg_time > 300:  # 5 minutes
            recommendations.append("Consider implementing parallel downloads")
            recommendations.append("Implement bandwidth optimization")

    return recommendations
```
