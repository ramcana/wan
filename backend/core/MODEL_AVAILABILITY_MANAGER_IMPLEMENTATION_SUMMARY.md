# Model Availability Manager Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the **Model Availability Manager** as the central coordination system for model availability, lifecycle management, and download prioritization. This component integrates with existing ModelManager, EnhancedModelDownloader, and ModelHealthMonitor to provide comprehensive model management capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. ModelAvailabilityManager Class

- **Location**: `backend/core/model_availability_manager.py`
- **Purpose**: Central coordination system for all model availability operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive model status aggregation
  - Download prioritization and queue management
  - Usage analytics tracking
  - Proactive model verification
  - Cleanup management for unused models

#### 2. Enhanced Data Models

**ModelAvailabilityStatus Enum**:

- `AVAILABLE`, `DOWNLOADING`, `MISSING`, `CORRUPTED`, `UPDATING`
- `QUEUED`, `PAUSED`, `FAILED`, `UNKNOWN`

**DetailedModelStatus Dataclass**:

- Basic status (availability, loading state, size)
- Enhanced availability info (download progress, missing files, integrity score)
- Health monitoring (last health check, performance score, corruption detection)
- Usage analytics (frequency, last used, generation time)
- Download management (pause/resume capabilities, ETA)
- Update info (version tracking, update availability)
- Priority and lifecycle management

**ModelRequestResult Dataclass**:

- Success status and availability information
- Estimated wait times and alternative models
- Action required indicators
- Error details for troubleshooting

#### 3. Key Functionality Implemented

**Model Status Aggregation**:

```python
async def get_comprehensive_model_status(self) -> Dict[str, DetailedModelStatus]
```

- Integrates data from ModelManager, EnhancedModelDownloader, and ModelHealthMonitor
- Provides unified view of all model states
- Includes health, usage, and download information

**Download Prioritization**:

```python
async def prioritize_model_downloads(self, usage_analytics: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> List[str]
```

- Prioritizes corrupted models first (need repair)
- Then missing models based on usage frequency and priority
- Supports CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW priority levels

**Model Request Handling**:

```python
async def handle_model_request(self, model_type: str) -> ModelRequestResult
```

- Ensures models are available before use
- Handles different scenarios (available, downloading, missing, corrupted, paused)
- Provides clear action guidance for each scenario
- Tracks usage for analytics

**Cleanup Management**:

```python
async def cleanup_unused_models(self, retention_policy: Optional[RetentionPolicy] = None) -> CleanupResult
```

- Analyzes model usage patterns
- Generates cleanup recommendations based on configurable policies
- Considers usage frequency, last used date, and model priority
- Preserves high-priority and recently downloaded models

**Usage Analytics**:

```python
async def _track_model_usage(self, model_type: str)
```

- Tracks model usage frequency and patterns
- Maintains 30-day usage history
- Calculates usage frequency (uses per day)
- Persists analytics data across sessions

#### 4. Integration Features

**Callback System**:

- Status update callbacks for health monitoring
- Download progress callbacks for real-time updates
- Extensible callback registration system

**Proactive Verification**:

```python
async def ensure_all_models_available(self) -> Dict[str, ModelAvailabilityStatus]
```

- Startup verification of all supported models
- Automatic queuing of missing models for download
- Health check scheduling for available models

**Error Handling**:

- Graceful error handling throughout all operations
- Detailed error reporting and logging
- Fallback behaviors for component failures

```

### Data Flow

1. **Startup Verification**:

   - Check all supported models (`t2v-A14B`, `i2v-A14B`, `ti2v-5B`)
   - Queue missing models for download
   - Schedule health checks for available models

2. **Model Request Handling**:

   - Check current availability status
   - Handle different scenarios (available/missing/downloading/corrupted)
   - Track usage for analytics
   - Provide clear action guidance

3. **Background Operations**:
   - Process download queue with priority ordering
   - Perform scheduled health checks
   - Update usage analytics
   - Generate cleanup recommendations

### Configuration and Policies
