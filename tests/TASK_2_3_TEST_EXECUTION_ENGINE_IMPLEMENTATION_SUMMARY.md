```bash
# Generate detailed report with JSON output
python tests/utils/test_runner_cli.py \
  --output test_report.txt \
  --json-output results.json \
  --verbose

# Run specific test patterns with retry disabled
python tests/utils/test_runner_cli.py \
  --pattern "*integration*" \
  --no-retry \
  --workers 2
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from utils.test_execution_engine import TestExecutionEngine, TestConfig

# Create custom configuration
config = TestConfig(
    max_workers=4,
    max_retries=2,
    timeouts={TestCategory.UNIT: 45}
)

# Run tests
engine = TestExecutionEngine(config)
result = engine.run_tests()
report = engine.generate_report(result, "report.txt")
