# Dependency Recovery System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 9: "Implement automatic recovery for dependency installation failures" from the Installation Reliability System specification. This system provides comprehensive automatic recovery mechanisms for dependency installation failures.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. DependencyRecovery Class (`dependency_recovery.py`)

- **Main recovery orchestrator** that handles all types of dependency installation failures
- **Multiple recovery strategies** with intelligent prioritization
- **Comprehensive error analysis** to select appropriate recovery methods
- **Hardware-aware recovery** considerations for optimal performance

#### 2. Recovery Strategies

Implemented 5 recovery strategies in order of priority:

1. **Cache Clear & Retry** (Priority 1, 75% success rate)

   - Clears pip cache and retries installation
   - Handles cache corruption, checksum errors

2. **Alternative Package Sources** (Priority 2, 70% success rate)

   - 5 alternative PyPI mirrors including Alibaba Cloud, Tsinghua, Douban, Microsoft
   - Automatic fallback between sources
   - Handles network timeouts, SSL errors, connectivity issues

3. **Version Fallback** (Priority 3, 65% success rate)

   - Predefined fallback versions for critical packages (torch, transformers, diffusers, numpy)
   - Intelligent version selection based on compatibility
   - Handles version conflicts and compatibility issues

4. **Virtual Environment Recreation** (Priority 4, 60% success rate)

   - Multiple fallback methods for venv creation
   - Handles environment corruption and permission issues
   - Hardware-optimized environment configuration

5. **Offline Installation** (Priority 5, 50% success rate)
   - Downloads packages for offline installation
   - Installs from local cache when network unavailable
   - Handles firewall restrictions and network isolation

#### 3. Key Features

**Virtual Environment Recreation:**

- Removes corrupted environments safely
- Multiple creation methods (venv, virtualenv, system Python)
- Hardware-specific optimizations
- Automatic configuration restoration

**Alternative Package Sources:**

- 5 reliable PyPI mirrors with reliability scoring
- Automatic source selection based on reliability
- Trusted host configuration for security
- Geographic optimization (China mirrors for better connectivity)

**Version Fallback Strategies:**

- Comprehensive fallback configurations for critical packages
- Compatibility notes and version constraints
- Intelligent fallback selection
- Support for unknown packages (removes version constraints)

**Offline Package Installation:**

- Package download and caching system
- Requirements file generation
- Support for wheel and tar.gz packages
- Offline-first installation when network unavailable

**Recovery Analytics:**

- Comprehensive logging of all recovery attempts
- Success rate tracking per strategy
- Recovery statistics and reporting
- Persistent recovery log for analysis

### Testing Implementation

#### Comprehensive Test Suite (`test_dependency_recovery.py`)

- **30 test cases** covering all functionality
- **Unit tests** for individual methods
- **Integration tests** for complete recovery scenarios
- **Mock-based testing** for reliable test execution
- **Edge case coverage** for error conditions

#### Test Categories:

1. **Initialization and Configuration Tests**
2. **Recovery Strategy Tests**
3. **Virtual Environment Recreation Tests**
4. **Alternative Source Installation Tests**
5. **Version Fallback Tests**
6. **Offline Installation Tests**
7. **Error Analysis Tests**
8. **Integration Scenario Tests**

### Demo Implementation

#### Interactive Demo (`demo_dependency_recovery.py`)

- **Complete system demonstration** with real-world scenarios
- **Strategy configuration showcase**
- **Error analysis simulation**
- **Hardware-aware recovery demonstration**
- **Connectivity testing** for alternative sources
- **Recovery statistics** and reporting

## Requirements Compliance

### ✅ Requirement 6.1: Virtual Environment Recreation

- **WHEN virtual environment creation fails THEN system SHALL clean up and recreate with different settings**
- Implemented with multiple fallback methods and comprehensive cleanup

### ✅ Requirement 6.2: Permission Error Handling

- **WHEN permission errors occur THEN system SHALL suggest running as administrator or fixing file permissions**
- Implemented through virtual environment recreation and error context

### ✅ Requirement 6.4: Alternative Download Sources

- **WHEN network timeouts happen THEN system SHALL switch to alternative download sources automatically**
- Implemented with 5 alternative PyPI mirrors and automatic fallback

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration

- **Compatible with existing DependencyManager** and PythonInstallationHandler
- **Extends current error handling** without breaking existing functionality
- **Uses established interfaces** and base classes
- **Maintains logging consistency** with existing system

### Usage Pattern

```python
# Initialize recovery system
recovery = DependencyRecovery(installation_path, dependency_manager)

# Handle dependency failure
try:
    dependency_manager.install_packages(requirements, hardware_profile)
except Exception as error:
    context = {"requirements": requirements, "hardware_profile": hardware_profile}
    success = recovery.recover_dependency_failure(error, context)
    if not success:
        # Escalate to manual intervention
        raise InstallationError("All recovery strategies failed")
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Efficiency Optimizations

- **Lazy initialization** of recovery components
- **Intelligent strategy selection** based on error analysis
- **Minimal overhead** during normal operations
- **Efficient caching** and resource management

### Resource Management

- **Automatic cleanup** of temporary files and directories
- **Memory-efficient** package caching
- **Disk space monitoring** during offline installation
- **Network bandwidth optimization** with source selection

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Machine Learning Integration** for strategy success prediction
2. **Network Quality Assessment** for source selection optimization
3. **Package Dependency Analysis** for smarter version fallbacks
4. **User Preference Learning** for personalized recovery strategies
5. **Cross-Installation Analytics** for system-wide optimization
