# ReliabilityManager Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: Build ReliabilityManager as Central Coordination System

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Requirements Addressed:** 1.2, 3.1, 7.3, 8.1

## Overview

The ReliabilityManager has been successfully implemented as the central coordination system for installation reliability operations. It provides comprehensive orchestration of all reliability components and serves as the primary interface for managing component reliability, failure handling, and recovery coordination.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Component Wrapping and Management

- **Automatic Component Wrapping**: Seamlessly wraps existing components with reliability enhancements
- **Component Type Detection**: Automatically detects component types (ModelDownloader, DependencyManager, etc.)
- **Centralized Registry**: Maintains registry of all wrapped components with unique identifiers
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All component operations are thread-safe with proper locking

### 2. Failure Handling Coordination

- **Intelligent Error Classification**: Classifies errors into categories for appropriate recovery strategy selection
- **Recovery Strategy Registry**: Maintains registry of recovery strategies for different error types
- **Recovery Session Tracking**: Tracks all recovery attempts with detailed session information
- **Escalation Logic**: Implements escalation for persistent failures

### 3. Recovery Strategy Selection and Execution

- **Multiple Recovery Strategies**: Supports retry, fallback, alternative sources, missing method recovery, model validation recovery, network failure recovery, and manual intervention
- **Context-Aware Selection**: Selects recovery strategies based on error type, component health, and failure history
- **Recovery Coordination**: Coordinates with specialized recovery systems (MissingMethodRecovery, ModelValidationRecovery, NetworkFailureRecovery)
- **Recovery Success Tracking**: Tracks success rates of different recovery strategies

### 4. Reliability Metrics Collection and Analysis

- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Collects detailed metrics on method calls, success rates, response times, and failure patterns
- **Component Health Tracking**: Monitors individual component health with success rates and failure counts
- **System-Wide Analytics**: Provides system-wide reliability metrics and uptime calculations
- **Real-Time Updates**: Updates metrics in real-time as operations occur

### 5. Component Health Monitoring and Tracking

- **Health Status Monitoring**: Continuously monitors component health status
- **Failure Pattern Detection**: Detects patterns of consecutive failures and degraded performance
- **Background Monitoring**: Optional background monitoring thread for continuous health checks
- **Health Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for determining component health status

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ReliabilityManager**: Central coordination class
2. **ComponentHealth**: Data structure for tracking component health
3. **ReliabilityMetrics**: System-wide reliability metrics
4. **RecoverySession**: Recovery attempt tracking
5. **Recovery Strategy Registry**: Mapping of error types to recovery strategies

### Integration Points

- **Error Handler**: Integrates with ComprehensiveErrorHandler for error processing
- **Reliability Wrapper**: Uses ReliabilityWrapperFactory for component wrapping
- **Recovery Systems**: Coordinates with specialized recovery systems:
  - MissingMethodRecovery
  - ModelValidationRecovery
  - NetworkFailureRecovery
  - IntelligentRetrySystem

### Key Methods

```python
# Component Management
wrap_component(component, component_type, component_id) -> ReliabilityWrapper
check_component_health(component_id) -> ComponentHealth
get_all_component_health() -> Dict[str, ComponentHealth]

# Failure Handling
handle_component_failure(component_id, error, context) -> RecoveryAction
get_recovery_strategy(error, component_id, context) -> RecoveryStrategy

# Metrics and Monitoring
track_reliability_metrics(component_id, operation, success, duration)
get_reliability_metrics() -> ReliabilityMetrics
start_monitoring() / stop_monitoring()

# Reporting
export_reliability_report(output_path) -> str
get_recovery_history() -> List[RecoverySession]
```

## Implementation Details

### Recovery Strategy Selection Logic

The ReliabilityManager implements intelligent recovery strategy selection based on:

1. **Error Type Classification**: Network, missing method, model validation, system, configuration, permission errors
2. **Component Health**: Success rates, consecutive failures, recovery attempts
3. **Context Information**: Retry counts, previous errors, operation details
4. **Strategy Availability**: Available recovery strategies for each error type

### Health Monitoring Algorithm

Component health is determined by:

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful operations
- **Consecutive Failures**: Number of consecutive failed operations
- **Recovery Attempts**: Number of recovery attempts made
- **Response Time**: Average response time for operations

A component is considered healthy if:

- Consecutive failures < max_consecutive_failures (default: 3)
- Success rate > 0.5 (50%)

### Metrics Collection

The system collects comprehensive metrics including:

- Total components managed
- Total method calls across all components
- Success/failure counts and rates
- Recovery attempt counts and success rates
- Average response times
- System uptime percentage

## Usage Example

```python
from reliability_manager import ReliabilityManager

# Initialize ReliabilityManager
manager = ReliabilityManager("/path/to/installation", logger)

# Wrap components
model_downloader = ModelDownloader()
wrapped_downloader = manager.wrap_component(
    model_downloader,
    component_type="model_downloader",
    component_id="main_downloader"
)

# Start monitoring
manager.start_monitoring()

# Use wrapped component (failures are automatically handled)
try:
    result = wrapped_downloader.download_models()
except Exception as e:
    # ReliabilityManager handles the failure and attempts recovery
    pass

# Check system health
metrics = manager.get_reliability_metrics()
health = manager.check_component_health("main_downloader")

# Generate report
report_path = manager.export_reliability_report()

# Cleanup
manager.stop_monitoring()
manager.shutdown()
```
