# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) support to the Wan2.2 video generation application. LoRAs allow users to fine-tune the video generation models with custom styles, characters, or concepts without retraining the entire model. This integration will enable users to load, manage, and apply LoRA weights to enhance their video generation capabilities with personalized content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want to load LoRA files into the application, so that I can apply custom styles and concepts to my video generations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the LoRA management section THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface for LoRA files
2. WHEN a user uploads a LoRA file (.safetensors or .ckpt format) THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and size
3. WHEN a valid LoRA file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in the configured loras_directory
4. WHEN a LoRA file upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
5. IF a LoRA file with the same name already exists THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to confirm overwrite or rename

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want to browse and select available LoRA models, so that I can choose which ones to apply to my video generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the LoRA selection interface THEN the system SHALL display all available LoRA files from the loras_directory
2. WHEN displaying LoRA files THEN the system SHALL show the filename, file size, and upload date for each LoRA
3. WHEN a user selects a LoRA THEN the system SHALL allow them to set the strength/weight value between 0.0 and 2.0
4. WHEN multiple LoRAs are selected THEN the system SHALL allow combining up to 5 LoRAs simultaneously
5. WHEN a LoRA is selected THEN the system SHALL validate that it's compatible with the current model

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want to apply LoRA weights during video generation, so that the output reflects the custom styles and concepts from the LoRA models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts video generation with LoRAs selected THEN the system SHALL load the LoRA weights into the model
2. WHEN LoRA weights are applied THEN the system SHALL respect the user-defined strength values for each LoRA
3. WHEN multiple LoRAs are applied THEN the system SHALL blend them according to their respective strength values
4. WHEN LoRA loading fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to generation without LoRAs and notify the user
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL include LoRA information in the metadata of generated videos

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want to manage my LoRA collection, so that I can organize and maintain my custom models effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the LoRA management interface THEN the system SHALL provide options to delete, rename, and organize LoRA files
2. WHEN a user deletes a LoRA THEN the system SHALL remove it from the filesystem and update the interface
3. WHEN a user renames a LoRA THEN the system SHALL update the filename while preserving the file integrity
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL scan the loras_directory and validate all LoRA files
5. IF corrupted or invalid LoRA files are found THEN the system SHALL log warnings and exclude them from the available list

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want to see LoRA performance impact, so that I can optimize my generation settings for the best balance of quality and speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LoRAs are applied THEN the system SHALL display estimated memory usage increase
2. WHEN generation starts with LoRAs THEN the system SHALL show loading progress for LoRA weight application
3. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL report the additional time taken due to LoRA processing
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL warn users about potential performance impact of multiple LoRAs
5. WHEN LoRA memory usage exceeds available VRAM THEN the system SHALL suggest reducing LoRA count or strength values
