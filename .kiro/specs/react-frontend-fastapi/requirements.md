# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a modern React-based frontend with FastAPI backend to replace the existing Gradio interface for the Wan2.2 video generation system. The new frontend will provide a professional, responsive user interface while maintaining all existing functionality through RESTful API endpoints. The system will support the same advanced features including Text-to-Video (T2V), Image-to-Video (I2V), and Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) generation modes with comprehensive VRAM optimization and queue management.

2. WHEN multiple items are in queue THEN the system SHALL display them in a modern card-based layout with drag-and-drop reordering
3. WHEN queue processing is active THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress with modern progress bars and status indicators
4. WHEN a queued task completes THEN the system SHALL provide desktop notifications and update UI with smooth transitions
5. WHEN queue is empty THEN the system SHALL display an attractive empty state with helpful suggestions

### Requirement 7
