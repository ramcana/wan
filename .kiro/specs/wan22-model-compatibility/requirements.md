# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Wan 2.2 T2V model is currently incompatible with standard Diffusers pipelines due to its custom architecture, including 3D transformers, custom VAE components, and non-standard configuration attributes. This feature aims to implement proper model compatibility handling, custom pipeline loading, and seamless integration with the existing UI system to enable successful video generation with the Wan 2.2 model.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and load Wan models using the correct custom pipeline based on architecture signatures, so that I can generate videos without encountering pipeline compatibility errors across different Wan variants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects architecture signatures (transformer_2, 3D VAE shape, boundary_ratio) THEN it SHALL automatically select the appropriate custom pipeline class
2. WHEN loading any Wan variant (T2V, T2I, mini versions) THEN the system SHALL use trust_remote_code=True and detect the correct pipeline type
3. WHEN model_index.json contains custom attributes THEN the system SHALL validate pipeline compatibility based on class name patterns and key attributes
4. IF the required custom pipeline class is not available THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for obtaining the pipeline code
5. WHEN pipeline code version mismatches with model weights THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and suggest version alignment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle VAE shape mismatches gracefully, so that the 3D video VAE loads correctly without falling back to random initialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the Wan VAE THEN the system SHALL recognize the 3D architecture and load weights correctly
2. WHEN VAE shape mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL NOT fall back to random initialization
3. WHEN the VAE has shape [384, ...] instead of [64, ...] THEN the system SHALL handle the dimensional difference appropriately
4. IF VAE loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about VAE compatibility requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to properly initialize the WanPipeline with the correct arguments, so that pipeline instantiation succeeds without "expected kwargs but only set() were passed" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN instantiating WanPipeline THEN the system SHALL provide all required initialization arguments
2. WHEN the pipeline expects specific kwargs THEN the system SHALL determine and provide the correct parameters
3. WHEN pipeline initialization fails THEN the system SHALL NOT fall back to StableDiffusionPipeline
4. IF required arguments are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about what arguments are needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive model compatibility detection and validation, so that I can quickly identify and resolve model loading issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is loaded THEN the system SHALL detect whether it requires custom pipeline handling
2. WHEN model components don't match standard Diffusers expectations THEN the system SHALL log detailed compatibility information
3. WHEN custom attributes are found in model configuration THEN the system SHALL validate their compatibility with available pipelines
4. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about the specific compatibility issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic fallback and optimization strategies when the ideal pipeline configuration is not available, so that I can still use the model with reduced functionality if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full WanPipeline is not available THEN the system SHALL attempt compatible fallback configurations
2. WHEN custom components cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL identify which components can be used independently
3. WHEN VRAM is insufficient for the full 3D pipeline THEN the system SHALL apply optimization strategies (mixed precision, CPU offload, sequential processing)
4. WHEN memory constraints exist THEN the system SHALL offer frame-by-frame generation and chunked decoding options
5. IF no compatible configuration is found THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on requirements and setup steps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic dependency management and remote code handling, so that I can use Wan models without manual pipeline code management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trust_remote_code=True is enabled and pipeline code is missing THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic fetching from Hugging Face
2. WHEN pipeline code versions don't match model requirements THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and suggest updates
3. WHEN remote code download fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and manual installation instructions
4. WHEN environment security policies restrict remote code THEN the system SHALL provide local installation alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless video output generation with proper encoding, so that I receive playable video files directly without additional post-processing steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation completes THEN the system SHALL automatically encode frame tensors to standard video formats (MP4, WebM)
2. WHEN frame rate and resolution settings are specified THEN the system SHALL apply them during video encoding
3. WHEN video encoding fails THEN the system SHALL provide frame-by-frame output as fallback
4. WHEN FFmpeg or video encoding dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and validation capabilities, so that I can verify model loading, inference, and output correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL run a built-in smoke test with minimal prompt to verify functionality
2. WHEN smoke test completes THEN the system SHALL validate output tensor shapes and basic video properties
3. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL test model loading, inference pipeline, and video output generation
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information about the specific failure points
