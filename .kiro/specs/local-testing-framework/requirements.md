# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive local testing framework for the Wan2.2 UI Variant that validates performance optimizations, system functionality, and deployment readiness. The framework provides automated testing capabilities to verify that the system meets all performance targets (720p < 9 minutes, 1080p < 17 minutes, VRAM < 12GB) and ensures reliable local deployment and testing workflows.

## Prioritization

- **Critical**: Requirements 1, 2, 3, and 5 for core testing functionality
- **High**: Requirements 4, 6, and 7 for automation and reporting
- **Medium**: Requirement 8 for production readiness
