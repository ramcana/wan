# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a robust installation reliability and error recovery system that addresses the persistent failures observed in the automated installation process. The system will implement comprehensive error handling, automatic retry mechanisms, detailed diagnostics, and recovery procedures to ensure successful installations even in challenging environments. This builds upon the existing local installation deployment system by adding resilience and self-healing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user experiencing installation failures, I want the system to automatically retry failed operations with intelligent backoff strategies, so that transient issues don't cause complete installation failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network operation fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s delays)
2. WHEN a dependency installation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative installation methods before giving up
3. WHEN model downloads fail THEN the system SHALL try different mirror sources, resume partial downloads, and check for authentication or rate-limiting errors, prompting the user for credentials or retrying after a longer delay if needed
4. WHEN retries are initiated THEN the system SHALL allow users to configure the maximum retry count or skip retries via a user prompt after the first failure
5. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL log detailed failure information and suggest manual recovery steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging installation issues, I want comprehensive error logging with full stack traces and system context, so that I can quickly identify and fix root causes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture complete stack traces with line numbers and file paths
2. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL log system state including OS version, CPU/GPU details, available memory, disk space, Python version, and relevant environment variables (e.g., PATH, PYTHONPATH)
3. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL track error chains and correlations between failures
4. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, error categories, and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with missing or incomplete method implementations, I want the system to detect and automatically fix common code issues, so that installation can proceed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN missing methods are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to load alternative implementations or fallbacks
2. WHEN class attribute errors occur THEN the system SHALL validate object initialization and suggest fixes
3. WHEN version mismatches are found THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic updates or compatibility shims
4. WHEN critical methods are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with specific fix instructions
5. WHEN missing methods or critical code issues cannot be resolved automatically THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to update to the latest software version or contact support with a pre-filled error report including logs and system state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user experiencing persistent model validation failures, I want the system to automatically diagnose and fix model issues, so that the "3 model issues" problem is resolved without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model validation fails THEN the system SHALL identify specific issues (missing files, corruption, wrong versions)
2. WHEN models are corrupted THEN the system SHALL automatically re-download affected models with integrity verification
3. WHEN models are missing THEN the system SHALL download them from primary and backup sources
4. WHEN model paths are incorrect THEN the system SHALL automatically fix directory structures and file locations
5. WHEN model validation fails after all recovery attempts THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed report of the specific model issues (e.g., file names, checksum failures, version mismatches) and pause installation for user intervention with guided manual steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to perform comprehensive pre-installation validation, so that potential issues are identified and resolved before the installation process begins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installation starts THEN the system SHALL check disk space, permissions, and network connectivity
2. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL verify package availability and version compatibility
3. WHEN system requirements are checked THEN the system SHALL validate hardware capabilities and driver versions
4. WHEN installation processes run THEN the system SHALL enforce timeouts for long-running operations (e.g., downloads, dependency installs) and clean up temporary files to prevent resource exhaustion
5. WHEN pre-validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps before allowing installation to proceed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic recovery mechanisms that can fix common installation problems without requiring technical knowledge, so that I can successfully install the system regardless of my technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN virtual environment creation fails THEN the system SHALL clean up and recreate with different settings
2. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest running as administrator or fixing file permissions
3. WHEN network timeouts happen THEN the system SHALL switch to alternative download sources automatically
4. WHEN configuration generation fails THEN the system SHALL use safe default configurations and continue installation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want detailed progress reporting and real-time status updates during error recovery, so that I understand what the system is doing to fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly messages explaining what went wrong
2. WHEN recovery attempts are made THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated completion times
3. WHEN multiple recovery strategies are tried THEN the system SHALL explain each approach and its likelihood of success
4. WHEN recovery succeeds THEN the system SHALL summarize what was fixed and continue with normal installation flow
5. WHEN recovery fails THEN the system SHALL provide links to official documentation, community support forums, or a support ticket system with pre-filled error details

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want installation health monitoring and reporting capabilities, so that I can proactively identify and address installation reliability issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installations complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed health reports with success/failure metrics
2. WHEN patterns of failures are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators to systemic issues
3. WHEN error trends are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest infrastructure or configuration improvements
4. WHEN installations succeed after recovery THEN the system SHALL log what recovery methods were effective for future use
5. WHEN multiple installations are monitored THEN the system SHALL aggregate health reports across instances and provide a centralized dashboard for error trends and recovery success rates
