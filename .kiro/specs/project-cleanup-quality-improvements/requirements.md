# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical quality and maintainability issues in the WAN22 project by implementing comprehensive cleanup, test suite stabilization, and configuration consolidation. The project currently suffers from broken/incomplete tests, scattered configuration files, and unclear project structure documentation, which impacts development velocity and system reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust and reliable test suite, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass without errors or failures
2. WHEN a test fails THEN the failure SHALL provide clear diagnostic information about the root cause
3. WHEN adding new functionality THEN corresponding tests SHALL be required and SHALL pass
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 5 minutes for full suite)
5. IF a test is flaky or intermittent THEN it SHALL be identified and fixed or marked as such
6. WHEN tests are run in different environments THEN they SHALL produce consistent results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear project structure documentation, so that I can quickly understand how different components relate to each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project THEN there SHALL be a comprehensive project structure document at the root level
2. WHEN examining any major component THEN its purpose and relationships SHALL be clearly documented
3. WHEN looking at the Local Testing Framework THEN its relationship to the main application SHALL be explicitly explained
4. WHEN reviewing configuration files THEN their purpose and scope SHALL be documented
5. IF there are multiple similar components THEN their differences and use cases SHALL be clarified
6. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN they SHALL be able to understand the project structure within 30 minutes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want unified configuration management, so that I can easily deploy and manage the application across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN all configuration SHALL be managed through a single, unified system
2. WHEN changing configuration THEN changes SHALL be applied consistently across all components
3. WHEN validating configuration THEN the system SHALL detect and report configuration conflicts or inconsistencies
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested fixes
5. WHEN migrating between environments THEN configuration SHALL be easily portable and environment-specific
6. WHEN backing up configuration THEN all settings SHALL be captured in a single operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized and clean codebase structure, so that I can maintain and extend the system efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or redundant files
2. WHEN examining any directory THEN its contents SHALL follow consistent naming and organization patterns
3. WHEN looking for functionality THEN related code SHALL be logically grouped and easy to locate
4. IF files are obsolete or unused THEN they SHALL be removed or clearly marked as deprecated
5. WHEN adding new features THEN there SHALL be clear guidelines for where code should be placed
6. WHEN reviewing code organization THEN the structure SHALL support the project's current and planned functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive code quality standards, so that the codebase maintains high standards and is easy to review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN it SHALL pass all automated quality checks
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN it SHALL follow consistent formatting and style guidelines
3. WHEN examining functions or classes THEN they SHALL have appropriate documentation and type hints
4. IF code violates quality standards THEN the violation SHALL be automatically detected and reported
5. WHEN refactoring code THEN quality metrics SHALL improve or remain stable
6. WHEN adding new code THEN it SHALL meet or exceed existing quality benchmarks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated cleanup and maintenance tools, so that code quality and organization are maintained over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running maintenance tools THEN they SHALL identify and fix common code quality issues
2. WHEN detecting unused files or dependencies THEN the system SHALL flag them for review
3. WHEN configuration drift occurs THEN automated tools SHALL detect and report inconsistencies
4. IF documentation becomes outdated THEN tools SHALL identify stale or missing documentation
5. WHEN performing cleanup operations THEN they SHALL be reversible and logged for audit purposes
6. WHEN maintenance is complete THEN a comprehensive report SHALL be generated showing all changes made
