# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing and enhancing the start and end image functionality in the Wan2.2 UI to properly align with the original Wan2.2 repository functionality. The current UI implementation has start/end image inputs but they are not properly visible or functioning as expected. This feature is critical for Image-to-Video (I2V) and Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) generation modes, allowing users to specify the first frame and optionally the last frame of generated videos.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to see and use start image inputs when selecting I2V or TI2V modes, so that I can generate videos from my existing images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "i2v-A14B" model type THEN the system SHALL display the start image upload interface prominently
2. WHEN the user selects "ti2v-5B" model type THEN the system SHALL display both start image upload and text prompt interfaces
3. WHEN the user selects "t2v-A14B" model type THEN the system SHALL hide the image upload interfaces
4. WHEN image inputs are visible THEN the system SHALL display clear labels and help text explaining their purpose

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to upload start and end frame images, so that I can control both the beginning and ending of my generated videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I2V or TI2V mode is selected THEN the system SHALL display a "Start Frame Image" upload area with clear labeling
2. WHEN I2V or TI2V mode is selected THEN the system SHALL display an "End Frame Image" upload area marked as optional
3. WHEN the user uploads a start image THEN the system SHALL validate the image format and dimensions
4. WHEN the user uploads an end image THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with the start image
5. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display thumbnails and validation status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback when uploading images, so that I know if my images are suitable for video generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL validate the file format (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP)
2. WHEN the user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL check minimum dimensions (256x256 pixels)
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL display a success message with image dimensions
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with specific requirements
5. WHEN both start and end images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate aspect ratio compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want helpful guidance about image requirements, so that I can prepare suitable images for video generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image upload areas are visible THEN the system SHALL display help text explaining image requirements
2. WHEN the user hovers over image upload areas THEN the system SHALL show tooltips with format and size requirements
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on how to fix the issues
4. WHEN images are successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display aspect ratio and resolution information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user generating videos, I want the start and end images to be properly passed to the generation engine, so that my videos use the specified frames.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Generate Now" with uploaded images THEN the system SHALL pass both start and end images to the generation function
2. WHEN the user clicks "Add to Queue" with uploaded images THEN the system SHALL include image data in the queued task
3. WHEN generation begins THEN the system SHALL use the start image as the first frame of the video
4. WHEN an end image is provided THEN the system SHALL use it as the target for the final frame
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL verify that the output video incorporates the specified frames

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to be responsive and show/hide image inputs dynamically, so that I only see relevant controls for my selected generation mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model type changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the visibility of image input controls
2. WHEN switching from T2V to I2V THEN the system SHALL smoothly reveal the image upload areas
3. WHEN switching from I2V to T2V THEN the system SHALL smoothly hide the image upload areas
4. WHEN model type changes THEN the system SHALL clear any validation messages from previous uploads
5. WHEN image inputs are hidden THEN the system SHALL preserve uploaded images for potential reuse

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with different screen sizes, I want the image upload interface to be responsive, so that I can use it effectively on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL display start and end image uploads side by side
2. WHEN viewing on mobile/tablet THEN the system SHALL stack image uploads vertically
3. WHEN image thumbnails are displayed THEN the system SHALL scale them appropriately for the screen size
4. WHEN validation messages are shown THEN the system SHALL format them to fit the available space
5. WHEN help text is displayed THEN the system SHALL remain readable on all supported screen sizes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clear or replace uploaded images easily, so that I can experiment with different starting frames.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a clear/remove button
2. WHEN the user clicks the clear button THEN the system SHALL remove the image and reset the upload area
3. WHEN the user uploads a new image THEN the system SHALL replace the previous image automatically
4. WHEN images are cleared THEN the system SHALL remove any associated validation messages
5. WHEN the user switches model types THEN the system SHALL preserve uploaded images for potential reuse

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see preview thumbnails of my uploaded images, so that I can verify I've selected the correct files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a thumbnail preview
2. WHEN thumbnails are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio and show clear image details
3. WHEN multiple images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display both thumbnails with clear labels
4. WHEN the user hovers over thumbnails THEN the system SHALL show full image dimensions and file size
5. WHEN thumbnails are clicked THEN the system SHALL display a larger preview of the image

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the resolution dropdown to show all supported resolutions for the selected model type, so that I can choose the appropriate output size for my videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "t2v-A14B" model THEN the system SHALL display resolution options: 854x480, 480x854, 1280x720, 1280x704, 1920x1080
2. WHEN the user selects "i2v-A14B" model THEN the system SHALL display resolution options: 854x480, 480x854, 1280x720, 1280x704, 1920x1080
3. WHEN the user selects "ti2v-5B" model THEN the system SHALL display resolution options: 854x480, 480x854, 1280x720, 1280x704, 1920x1080, 1024x1024
4. WHEN the model type changes THEN the system SHALL update the resolution dropdown immediately
5. WHEN an unsupported resolution is selected THEN the system SHALL automatically select the closest supported resolution

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a progress bar with generation statistics during video creation, so that I can track the progress and estimated completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar showing completion percentage
2. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show current step number and total steps
3. WHEN generation is running THEN the system SHALL display estimated time remaining
4. WHEN generation progresses THEN the system SHALL update statistics in real-time (frames processed, current phase)
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL show final statistics (total time, frames per second processed)

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image functionality to integrate seamlessly with existing generation and queue systems, so that the feature works reliably across all workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in the GenerationTask data structure
2. WHEN tasks are queued THEN the system SHALL preserve image data for batch processing
3. WHEN generation functions are called THEN the system SHALL receive properly formatted image parameters
4. WHEN errors occur during generation THEN the system SHALL maintain image data for retry attempts
