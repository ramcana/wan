# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a shareable, automated installation package that runs via a Windows batch file (.bat) and automatically detects system specifications. Similar to WebUI Forge's installation approach, this will be a self-contained installer that can be distributed to users and will automatically configure the local testing framework for optimal performance on their specific hardware, with special optimizations for high-performance systems like AMD Threadripper PRO with RTX GPUs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single batch file that I can run to automatically install and configure the entire system, so that I don't need to manually handle dependencies or configuration steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I double-click the install.bat file THEN the system SHALL begin automatic installation without requiring additional user input
2. WHEN the batch file runs THEN the system SHALL automatically detect my CPU, RAM, GPU, and operating system specifications
3. WHEN system detection completes THEN the system SHALL display detected hardware information and proceed with optimized configuration
4. WHEN installation finishes THEN the system SHALL create desktop shortcuts and start menu entries for easy access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the installer to automatically handle all dependencies and create a portable installation, so that I can share the installation package with others or move it between systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installer runs THEN the system SHALL automatically download and install Python if not present
2. WHEN Python is available THEN the system SHALL create a virtual environment and install all required packages
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL bundle everything into a self-contained directory structure
4. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL be fully portable and not require system-wide installations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with varying hardware configurations, I want the system to automatically detect and optimize for my specific hardware, so that I get the best performance regardless of my system specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardware detection runs THEN the system SHALL identify CPU cores, RAM amount, GPU model, and available storage
2. WHEN high-performance hardware is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically configure optimal thread counts and memory allocation
3. WHEN RTX GPUs are detected THEN the system SHALL enable GPU acceleration and configure CUDA settings
4. WHEN lower-end hardware is detected THEN the system SHALL configure conservative settings to ensure stability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear progress indication and helpful error messages during installation, so that I know what's happening and can troubleshoot if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installation runs THEN the system SHALL display progress bars and status messages in the command window
2. WHEN downloading components THEN the system SHALL show download progress and estimated time remaining
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL display a success message and next steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the installer to verify that everything is working correctly after installation, so that I can start using the system immediately with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL automatically run basic functionality tests
2. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL verify that all core components can start and communicate properly
3. WHEN hardware optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL run a quick performance test to validate settings
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL offer to launch the application or provide usage instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user running the system for the first time, I want the installer to automatically download and configure the WAN2.2 models, so that the system is ready to use immediately without any manual model setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs for the first time THEN the system SHALL detect if WAN2.2 models are missing from the models directory
2. WHEN WAN2.2 models need to be downloaded THEN the system SHALL automatically download them from the official repositories without user intervention
3. WHEN downloading WAN2.2 models THEN the system SHALL show download progress with file names and sizes
4. WHEN WAN2.2 models are downloaded THEN the system SHALL automatically place them in the correct directory structure and verify their integrity

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the installation package to be easily shareable and work consistently across different Windows systems, so that I can distribute it to team members or use it on multiple machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installation package is created THEN the system SHALL bundle all necessary files into a single distributable folder
2. WHEN the package is shared THEN the system SHALL work on different Windows versions (Windows 10/11) without modification
3. WHEN running on different hardware THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt to each system's capabilities
4. WHEN updates are needed THEN the system SHALL provide an easy update mechanism that preserves user configurations
