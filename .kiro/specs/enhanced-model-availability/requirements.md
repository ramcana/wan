# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the model availability and download management system to provide more reliable model access, better download retry mechanisms, and improved user experience when models are missing or partially downloaded. The system currently falls back to mock generation when models are unavailable, but users need better visibility into model status, automatic retry mechanisms, and more robust download completion verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic model download retry with intelligent recovery, so that temporary download failures don't prevent me from using real AI models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model download fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN a model has missing files THEN the system SHALL attempt to re-download only the missing components
3. WHEN download retry succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically switch from mock to real generation
4. WHEN all retries fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on manual resolution steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive model status visibility, so that I can understand which models are available and what actions I can take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check model status THEN the system SHALL show download progress, file integrity, and availability for each model
2. WHEN models are partially downloaded THEN the system SHALL show which specific files are missing
3. WHEN models are corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide options to re-download or repair
4. WHEN models are ready THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate they can be used for generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proactive model management, so that the system ensures models are ready before I need them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify all model integrity and trigger downloads for missing models
2. WHEN a generation request is made THEN the system SHALL ensure the required model is fully available before starting
3. WHEN models are updated remotely THEN the system SHALL detect version mismatches and offer updates
4. WHEN disk space is low THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest cleanup options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent fallback behavior, so that the system provides the best possible experience even when models aren't available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a preferred model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative available models
2. WHEN no models are available THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for model setup
3. WHEN models are downloading THEN the system SHALL estimate completion time and allow queuing requests
4. WHEN fallback to mock is used THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this and provide upgrade paths

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want model download management controls, so that I can manage bandwidth usage and storage efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading models THEN I SHALL be able to pause, resume, or cancel downloads
2. WHEN multiple models need downloading THEN I SHALL be able to prioritize which models download first
3. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN I SHALL be able to set download speed limits
4. WHEN storage is limited THEN I SHALL be able to choose which models to keep locally

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want model health monitoring, so that the system can detect and resolve model issues automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are loaded THEN the system SHALL verify their integrity and performance
2. WHEN model corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt repair or re-download
3. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL suggest optimization or re-download
4. WHEN models are unused for extended periods THEN the system SHALL offer to free up space

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless model updates, so that I can benefit from improved model versions without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new model versions are available THEN the system SHALL notify me and offer to update
2. WHEN I approve updates THEN the system SHALL download new versions while keeping old ones until verified
3. WHEN updates are complete THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to new versions
4. WHEN updates fail THEN the system SHALL rollback to previous working versions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want model usage analytics, so that I can understand which models I use most and optimize my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use models THEN the system SHALL track usage frequency and performance metrics
2. WHEN I check analytics THEN the system SHALL show which models are used most frequently
3. WHEN storage is needed THEN the system SHALL suggest removing least-used models
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL correlate with usage patterns and suggest optimizations
