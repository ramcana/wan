# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the real AI models (T2V-A14B, I2V-A14B, TI2V-5B) from the existing Wan2.2 system (`backend/main.py`) into the FastAPI backend (`backend/app.py`) to enable actual video generation instead of the current mock implementation. The integration will leverage existing components from the local installation system including the ModelManager, ModelDownloader, and WAN pipeline infrastructure while connecting the React frontend to the real AI processing pipeline and maintaining the existing API structure and WebSocket communication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the FastAPI backend to use real AI models for video generation, so that I can generate actual videos instead of placeholder files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a generation request is submitted THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate real AI model (T2V-A14B, I2V-A14B, or TI2V-5B)
2. WHEN the model is loaded THEN the system SHALL use the actual Wan2.2 generation pipeline from `backend/main.py`
3. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL produce real MP4 video files instead of placeholder text files
4. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages with recovery suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle GPU memory management automatically, so that I don't experience VRAM exhaustion errors during generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple generation requests are queued THEN the system SHALL manage GPU memory efficiently
2. WHEN VRAM is insufficient THEN the system SHALL apply model offloading or quantization automatically
3. WHEN a model is not in use THEN the system SHALL unload it to free GPU memory
4. WHEN VRAM usage exceeds 90% THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest optimization settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time progress updates during video generation, so that I can track the generation process and estimated completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation starts THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates via WebSocket
2. WHEN each generation step completes THEN the system SHALL update the progress percentage
3. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide estimated time remaining
4. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL notify the frontend immediately via WebSocket

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to leverage the existing model download infrastructure, so that I can use any model type with the proven download and validation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is requested but not available locally THEN the system SHALL use the existing ModelDownloader to download it automatically
2. WHEN downloading models THEN the system SHALL use the existing Hugging Face Hub integration with progress tracking
3. WHEN model download fails THEN the system SHALL use the existing error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN models are downloaded THEN the system SHALL use the existing integrity verification system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want LoRA support integrated with real models, so that I can use custom LoRA files to modify generation style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a LoRA file is specified THEN the system SHALL load and apply it to the generation process
2. WHEN LoRA strength is adjusted THEN the system SHALL apply the correct strength value
3. WHEN LoRA loading fails THEN the system SHALL continue generation without LoRA and warn the user
4. WHEN multiple LoRAs are used THEN the system SHALL handle them according to the model's capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility with the existing API, so that the React frontend continues to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is complete THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN generation requests are made THEN the request/response format SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN WebSocket messages are sent THEN the message format SHALL remain compatible
4. WHEN the system starts THEN both mock and real generation modes SHALL be available for testing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and recovery, so that system failures don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to mock mode with user notification
2. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and mark the task as failed
3. WHEN CUDA errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to leverage existing hardware optimization systems, so that generation runs as efficiently as possible with proven optimization strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL use the existing WAN22SystemOptimizer for hardware detection
2. WHEN hardware is detected THEN it SHALL apply the existing optimization configurations from ModelConfigurationManager
3. WHEN generation parameters are set THEN it SHALL use existing hardware validation from the optimization system
4. WHEN hardware changes THEN it SHALL leverage existing adaptive optimization mechanisms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to integrate with existing model management infrastructure, so that I can benefit from the proven model loading and caching systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models need to be loaded THEN the system SHALL use the existing ModelManager from core/services
2. WHEN model metadata is needed THEN the system SHALL use the existing ModelConfigurationManager
3. WHEN model files need organization THEN the system SHALL use existing directory structure management
4. WHEN model status is checked THEN the system SHALL use existing validation and integrity checking
