# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for reviewing the `feature/modernize-ui` branch from https://github.com/ramcana/wan/tree/feature/modernize-ui. The review will evaluate the proposed UI modernization changes against our existing React frontend implementation and ensure they align with our established design principles and user experience goals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to review the modernize-ui branch changes systematically, so that I can ensure the proposed modifications enhance the existing React frontend without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the branch is reviewed THEN the system SHALL identify all modified files and their purposes
2. WHEN UI components are changed THEN the system SHALL verify they maintain existing functionality
3. WHEN new UI patterns are introduced THEN the system SHALL ensure they follow established design principles
4. WHEN styling changes are made THEN the system SHALL confirm they improve user experience
5. WHEN the review is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback for integration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a UI/UX designer, I want to evaluate the visual and interaction improvements in the branch, so that I can ensure the modernization enhances usability and accessibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visual changes are reviewed THEN the system SHALL assess consistency with existing design system
2. WHEN interaction patterns are modified THEN the system SHALL verify they improve user workflow
3. WHEN accessibility features are updated THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines
4. WHEN responsive design changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate cross-device compatibility
5. WHEN animations or transitions are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they enhance rather than distract

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to assess the technical implementation quality of the branch changes, so that I can ensure code maintainability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component architecture is modified THEN the system SHALL verify proper separation of concerns
2. WHEN state management changes are made THEN the system SHALL ensure efficient data flow
3. WHEN new dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL assess their necessity and bundle impact
4. WHEN TypeScript types are updated THEN the system SHALL verify type safety improvements
5. WHEN performance optimizations are implemented THEN the system SHALL validate their effectiveness

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to understand how the branch changes align with our modernization roadmap, so that I can make informed decisions about integration priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN features are added or modified THEN the system SHALL map them to existing requirements
2. WHEN user workflows are changed THEN the system SHALL assess impact on user experience
3. WHEN technical debt is addressed THEN the system SHALL quantify improvements
4. WHEN new capabilities are introduced THEN the system SHALL evaluate their strategic value
5. WHEN integration effort is estimated THEN the system SHALL provide realistic timelines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to identify potential testing requirements for the branch changes, so that I can ensure quality assurance coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new components are added THEN the system SHALL identify required unit tests
2. WHEN user interactions are modified THEN the system SHALL specify integration test scenarios
3. WHEN API integrations are changed THEN the system SHALL outline backend compatibility tests
4. WHEN accessibility features are updated THEN the system SHALL define accessibility test cases
5. WHEN performance changes are made THEN the system SHALL establish performance benchmarks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to understand deployment and configuration impacts of the branch changes, so that I can plan for smooth integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build processes are modified THEN the system SHALL document configuration changes
2. WHEN environment variables are added THEN the system SHALL specify deployment requirements
3. WHEN asset management changes THEN the system SHALL outline CDN or static file impacts
4. WHEN API endpoints are modified THEN the system SHALL identify backend coordination needs
5. WHEN security considerations arise THEN the system SHALL highlight potential vulnerabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want a comprehensive assessment of the branch's readiness for integration, so that I can coordinate merge activities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the review is complete THEN the system SHALL provide an overall readiness score
2. WHEN issues are identified THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and impact
3. WHEN integration steps are defined THEN the system SHALL provide a clear action plan
4. WHEN risks are assessed THEN the system SHALL suggest mitigation strategies
5. WHEN approval is given THEN the system SHALL outline post-merge validation steps
