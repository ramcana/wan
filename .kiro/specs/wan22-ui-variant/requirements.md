# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a dedicated web-based user interface for the Wan2.2 video generative models. The UI will be built using Gradio and optimized for NVIDIA RTX 4080 hardware, supporting advanced features like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) hybrid generation, and VACE Experimental Cocktail aesthetics. The system will provide an intuitive interface for generating high-quality videos up to 1920x1080 resolution at 24fps while maintaining efficient VRAM usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a web-based interface to generate videos from text prompts, so that I can create visual content without complex command-line operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a Gradio-based UI with four main tabs: Generation, Optimizations, Queue & Stats, and Outputs
2. WHEN the user enters a text prompt THEN the system SHALL accept prompts up to 500 characters in length
3. WHEN the user selects Text-to-Video (T2V) mode THEN the system SHALL generate video content based solely on the text prompt
4. WHEN the user initiates video generation THEN the system SHALL complete 720p video generation in under 9 minutes on RTX 4080 hardware

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to generate videos from existing images, so that I can extend static content into dynamic sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects Image-to-Video (I2V) mode THEN the system SHALL display an image upload interface
2. WHEN the user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL accept common formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP) up to 10MB
3. WHEN the user provides both image and text prompt THEN the system SHALL generate video that extends or animates the input image
4. WHEN using I2V mode THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency between the input image and generated video frames

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to use hybrid Text-Image-to-Video generation, so that I can leverage both textual and visual inputs for precise video creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects TI2V mode THEN the system SHALL accept both text prompt and image input simultaneously
2. WHEN both inputs are provided THEN the system SHALL generate video that incorporates elements from both the text description and visual reference
3. WHEN using TI2V-5B model THEN the system SHALL support resolutions up to 1920x1080
4. WHEN processing TI2V requests THEN the system SHALL complete generation within 17 minutes for 1080p content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with limited GPU memory, I want VRAM optimization options, so that I can generate videos without running out of memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses optimization settings THEN the system SHALL provide quantization options (fp16, bf16, int8)
2. WHEN the user enables model offloading THEN the system SHALL move model components between GPU and CPU memory as needed
3. WHEN the user adjusts VAE tile size THEN the system SHALL accept values between 128-512 pixels
4. WHEN generating 720p video with optimizations THEN the system SHALL use no more than 12GB VRAM
5. WHEN VRAM usage exceeds available memory THEN the system SHALL display an out-of-memory error with suggested optimizations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to enhance my prompts automatically, so that I can achieve better video quality without extensive prompt engineering knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Enhance Prompt" THEN the system SHALL append quality-improving keywords to the original prompt
2. WHEN VACE aesthetics are detected in the prompt THEN the system SHALL add cinematic style enhancements
3. WHEN prompt enhancement is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve the original creative intent while improving technical quality
4. WHEN enhanced prompts are generated THEN the system SHALL display the modified prompt to the user for review

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user generating multiple videos, I want a queuing system, so that I can batch process multiple requests without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Add to Queue" THEN the system SHALL add the current generation request to a FIFO queue
2. WHEN multiple items are in queue THEN the system SHALL process them sequentially in first-in-first-out order
3. WHEN queue processing is active THEN the system SHALL display current queue status with task details and progress
4. WHEN a queued task completes THEN the system SHALL automatically start the next task in queue
5. WHEN queue is empty THEN the system SHALL display "No pending tasks" status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time resource monitoring, so that I can track system performance and prevent hardware issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the Queue & Stats tab THEN the system SHALL display current CPU, RAM, GPU, and VRAM usage percentages
2. WHEN stats are displayed THEN the system SHALL refresh metrics every 5 seconds automatically
3. WHEN the user clicks "Refresh Stats" THEN the system SHALL immediately update all performance metrics
4. WHEN VRAM usage approaches 90% THEN the system SHALL display a warning message
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN the system SHALL show both used and total memory values

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to browse and manage generated videos, so that I can review and organize my created content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN videos are generated THEN the system SHALL save them to an outputs/ directory with MP4 format
2. WHEN the user accesses the Outputs tab THEN the system SHALL display a gallery of all generated videos
3. WHEN videos are displayed THEN the system SHALL show thumbnails with generation metadata (prompt, resolution, timestamp)
4. WHEN the user clicks on a video thumbnail THEN the system SHALL display the full video with playback controls
5. WHEN videos are saved THEN the system SHALL include generation parameters in the filename or metadata

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want LoRA support for VACE aesthetics, so that I can apply specific artistic styles to my generated videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a LoRA path THEN the system SHALL load and apply the specified LoRA weights
2. WHEN VACE LoRA is applied THEN the system SHALL enhance video aesthetics with cinematic styling
3. WHEN LoRA files are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to prompt-based aesthetic enhancements
4. WHEN LoRA weights are loaded THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of LoRA influence strength (0.0-2.0)

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want model auto-downloading, so that I don't need to manually manage model files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a model type THEN the system SHALL automatically download required models from Hugging Face if not present locally
2. WHEN models are downloaded THEN the system SHALL store them in a models/ directory
3. WHEN download is in progress THEN the system SHALL display download progress and estimated time remaining
4. WHEN models are cached locally THEN the system SHALL use cached versions instead of re-downloading
5. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting suggestions
