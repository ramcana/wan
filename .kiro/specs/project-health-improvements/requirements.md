# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical project health issues that are impacting maintainability and reliability of the WAN22 video generation system. The project currently suffers from three major weaknesses: a broken and incomplete test suite, scattered documentation across multiple locations, and fragmented configuration management spread across numerous files. These issues make the project difficult to maintain, test, and deploy reliably.

The goal is to establish a robust foundation for the project by implementing a comprehensive test suite, centralizing documentation, and unifying the configuration system into a cohesive, manageable structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Test Suite Overhaul

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable and comprehensive test suite, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL run all tests successfully with at least 80% pass rate
2. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
3. WHEN new code is added THEN the system SHALL have corresponding unit tests with minimum 70% code coverage
4. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL validate end-to-end workflows including model loading, generation, and API responses
5. IF a test is broken or incomplete THEN the system SHALL either fix the test or remove it with proper documentation
6. WHEN performance tests are executed THEN the system SHALL validate system performance meets baseline requirements
7. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL complete execution within 15 minutes for the full suite
8. WHEN tests are categorized THEN the system SHALL organize tests into unit, integration, performance, and end-to-end categories

### Requirement 2: Centralized Documentation System

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want all documentation in a single, organized location, so that I can quickly find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a single entry point for all project documentation
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all related documents
3. WHEN searching for information THEN the system SHALL provide searchable and well-organized documentation structure
4. IF documentation exists in multiple locations THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into the centralized system
5. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL require corresponding documentation updates
6. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation between related topics
7. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL auto-generate API docs from code annotations
8. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive troubleshooting guides with common issues and solutions

### Requirement 3: Unified Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a single, unified configuration system, so that I can manage all system settings from one location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL provide a single configuration file or interface for all settings
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate configuration values before applying them
3. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from the unified system with clear error messages for invalid configs
4. IF configuration files are scattered THEN the system SHALL migrate them to the unified configuration system
5. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN the system SHALL support environment overrides (dev, staging, production)
6. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL provide backup and rollback capabilities
7. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
8. WHEN configuration is accessed programmatically THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent API for reading configuration values

### Requirement 4: Project Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated health monitoring, so that I can proactively identify and address project health issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health check runs THEN the system SHALL validate test suite health and report broken tests
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL check for broken links and outdated information
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate configuration consistency across the project
4. WHEN code quality checks run THEN the system SHALL report code coverage, complexity, and maintainability metrics
5. IF project health issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for fixes
6. WHEN health reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide both summary and detailed views
7. WHEN health monitoring runs THEN the system SHALL complete checks within 5 minutes
8. WHEN critical issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide priority levels and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 5: Developer Experience Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved tooling and workflows, so that I can be more productive and make fewer mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide automated setup scripts with clear instructions
2. WHEN running tests locally THEN the system SHALL provide fast feedback with watch mode and selective test execution
3. WHEN making configuration changes THEN the system SHALL provide validation and auto-completion in development tools
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and debugging tools
5. IF development dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL detect and guide installation of required tools
6. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit hooks to validate code quality and tests
7. WHEN documentation is written THEN the system SHALL provide templates and style guides for consistency
8. WHEN new developers join THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive onboarding documentation and setup guides
