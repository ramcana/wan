# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a robust server startup and port management system for the WAN22 video generation application. The system needs to handle common Windows development issues including port conflicts, permission errors, and provide a reliable way to start both the FastAPI backend and React frontend servers with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server startup script to automatically detect and resolve port conflicts, so that I can start the application without manual intervention when ports are already in use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the startup script runs THEN the system SHALL check if the default ports (8000 for backend, 3000 for frontend) are available
2. WHEN a port is already in use THEN the system SHALL automatically find the next available port and update configuration accordingly
3. WHEN alternative ports are used THEN the system SHALL display clear messages showing which ports are being used
4. WHEN port detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with suggested solutions
5. WHEN servers start successfully THEN the system SHALL display clickable URLs for easy access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the startup script to handle Windows permission errors gracefully, so that I can resolve access issues without cryptic error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL detect the specific type of permission issue (firewall, admin rights, etc.)
2. WHEN firewall blocking is detected THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for adding firewall exceptions
3. WHEN admin rights are needed THEN the system SHALL offer to restart with elevated permissions
4. WHEN socket access is forbidden THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative solutions and port ranges
5. WHEN permission issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically retry server startup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the startup script to validate the environment before starting servers, so that I can identify and fix configuration issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL verify that all required dependencies are installed (Python, Node.js, npm)
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide specific installation instructions for each missing component
3. WHEN virtual environments are not activated THEN the system SHALL detect and offer to activate them automatically
4. WHEN configuration files are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL create default configurations or repair corrupted ones
5. WHEN environment validation passes THEN the system SHALL proceed with server startup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent process management for the servers, so that I can avoid conflicts from previous runs and ensure clean startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL check for existing server processes on the target ports
2. WHEN existing processes are found THEN the system SHALL offer options to kill them or use different ports
3. WHEN processes are killed THEN the system SHALL wait for proper cleanup before starting new servers
4. WHEN servers fail to start THEN the system SHALL clean up partial processes and provide rollback
5. WHEN servers are running THEN the system SHALL monitor their health and provide restart options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging information, so that I can troubleshoot startup issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN startup begins THEN the system SHALL create detailed logs of all operations and checks
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log full error details with timestamps and context
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide verbose mode with step-by-step information
4. WHEN logs are created THEN the system SHALL organize them by date and provide easy access
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL include system information and environment details in logs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the startup script to provide a user-friendly interface, so that I can easily understand what's happening and take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and clear status messages
2. WHEN user input is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear prompts with available options
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN servers are starting THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates and estimated completion times
5. WHEN startup completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of running services and next steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the startup script to handle different development scenarios, so that I can work efficiently in various situations (first-time setup, daily development, debugging).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running for the first time THEN the system SHALL guide through initial setup and configuration
2. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL enable hot reloading and development features
3. WHEN running in production mode THEN the system SHALL optimize for performance and disable debug features
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide options to start servers individually with detailed logging
5. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL preserve user preferences and configurations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic recovery and retry mechanisms, so that temporary issues don't require manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temporary network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN services fail to start initially THEN the system SHALL retry with different configurations automatically
3. WHEN dependencies are temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL wait and retry with timeout limits
4. WHEN partial failures occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover individual components without full restart
5. WHEN recovery attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide manual intervention options with clear guidance
