# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical system anomalies and optimization issues identified in the WAN2.2 UI application running on RTX 4080 hardware. The system currently experiences several issues including syntax errors in enhanced event handlers, VRAM detection failures, unexpected quantization behavior, configuration mismatches, and incomplete initialization processes. This feature will systematically resolve these issues to ensure stable, optimized performance tailored for high-end hardware configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Event Handlers Stability

**User Story:** As a user running WAN2.2 UI, I want the enhanced event handlers to load without syntax errors, so that I can access all advanced UI features and interactive controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the enhanced event handlers SHALL load without syntax errors
2. WHEN enhanced event handlers fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with specific line numbers and suggested fixes
3. WHEN enhanced event handlers are successfully loaded THEN all advanced UI features SHALL be available including real-time previews and interactive controls
4. IF enhanced event handlers cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to basic handlers with a clear notification to the user

### Requirement 2: Accurate VRAM Detection and Management

**User Story:** As a user with an RTX 4080 (16GB VRAM), I want the system to accurately detect and manage my GPU memory, so that I can optimize model loading and prevent out-of-memory errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL accurately detect the RTX 4080's 16GB VRAM capacity
2. WHEN VRAM detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to manually specify VRAM capacity
3. WHEN loading the TI2V-5B model THEN the system SHALL monitor VRAM usage and provide warnings when approaching capacity limits
4. IF VRAM usage exceeds 90% THEN the system SHALL automatically apply memory optimization techniques
5. WHEN VRAM is successfully detected THEN the system SHALL display current usage and available memory in the UI

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Quantization Management

**User Story:** As a user who has experienced quantization timeouts, I want the system to intelligently manage quantization based on my hardware capabilities, so that I can achieve optimal performance without system hangs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quantization is enabled THEN the system SHALL complete the process within the specified timeout period
2. WHEN quantization times out THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to non-quantized mode with user notification
3. WHEN the user has previously disabled quantization THEN the system SHALL remember this preference and not attempt quantization
4. IF quantization is attempted THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and allow user cancellation
5. WHEN quantization settings are changed THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with the current model and hardware

### Requirement 4: Configuration Validation and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to validate and clean up configuration files automatically, so that I don't encounter warnings about unexpected attributes or mismatched settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all configuration files against expected schemas
2. WHEN unexpected configuration attributes are found THEN the system SHALL either correct them automatically or provide clear guidance for manual correction
3. WHEN configuration mismatches are detected THEN the system SHALL create backup copies before making any changes
4. IF configuration files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL restore from known good defaults
5. WHEN configuration validation completes THEN the system SHALL report all changes made to the user

### Requirement 5: Hardware-Optimized Performance Settings

**User Story:** As a user with high-end hardware (Threadripper PRO 5995WX, 128GB RAM, RTX 4080), I want the system to automatically optimize settings for my configuration, so that I can achieve maximum performance without manual tuning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application detects high-end hardware THEN the system SHALL automatically apply optimized settings for CPU cores, memory allocation, and GPU utilization
2. WHEN hardware capabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal tile sizes, batch sizes, and memory management strategies
3. WHEN performance optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL provide before/after performance metrics
4. IF hardware detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual configuration options with recommended values
5. WHEN optimization settings are changed THEN the system SHALL validate that the changes don't exceed hardware limits

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Error Recovery and Logging

**User Story:** As a user troubleshooting system issues, I want comprehensive error logging and automatic recovery mechanisms, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems without losing work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information including stack traces, system state, and recovery actions taken
2. WHEN critical errors are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery before failing
3. WHEN the application crashes or hangs THEN the system SHALL save current state and provide recovery options on restart
4. IF recovery is not possible THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for manual resolution
5. WHEN logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL rotate log files to prevent disk space issues

### Requirement 7: Model Loading Optimization

**User Story:** As a user loading large models like TI2V-5B, I want optimized loading processes with progress tracking, so that I can monitor loading progress and understand any delays or issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large models THEN the system SHALL display detailed progress information including current step, estimated time remaining, and memory usage
2. WHEN model loading encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested solutions
3. WHEN models are successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL cache loading parameters for faster subsequent loads
4. IF model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options including alternative models or reduced quality settings
5. WHEN multiple models are available THEN the system SHALL recommend the best model for the current hardware configuration

### Requirement 8: System Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user running intensive AI workloads, I want continuous system health monitoring, so that I can prevent hardware damage and maintain optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor GPU temperature, VRAM usage, CPU usage, and system memory
2. WHEN hardware metrics exceed safe thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce workload or pause operations
3. WHEN system health issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide real-time alerts and recommended actions
4. IF critical hardware issues are detected THEN the system SHALL safely shut down operations to prevent damage
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide a dashboard showing current system status and historical trends
