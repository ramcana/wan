# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Wan2.2 Video Generation UI is currently experiencing generation failures with the error message "Generation failed. Invalid input provided. Please check your settings and try again." This feature aims to diagnose and fix the underlying issues preventing successful video generation, ensuring users can reliably generate videos using the T2V (Text-to-Video), I2V (Image-to-Video), and T2V (Text+Image-to-Video) capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully generate videos without encountering "Invalid input provided" errors, so that I can create video content using the Wan2.2 model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid input parameters THEN the system SHALL process the generation request without validation errors
2. WHEN the generation process starts THEN the system SHALL provide clear status updates and progress indicators
3. WHEN generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the output video to the specified location
4. IF input validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating which parameters are invalid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about what input parameters are causing validation failures, so that I can correct my settings and successfully generate videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each invalid parameter
2. WHEN parameter constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL show the valid ranges or formats expected
3. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on model requirements and availability
4. IF configuration issues exist THEN the system SHALL suggest specific remediation steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the video generation system to handle different input types (text-only, image+text) correctly, so that I can use all available generation modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using T2V mode with text input THEN the system SHALL validate text prompt requirements and generate video accordingly
2. WHEN using I2V mode with image input THEN the system SHALL validate image format, size, and generate video from the image
3. WHEN using T2V mode with text+image THEN the system SHALL validate both inputs and generate video combining both modalities
4. WHEN switching between generation modes THEN the system SHALL update validation rules and UI elements appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for the generation pipeline, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and parameter values
2. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL log specific model path and loading error details
3. WHEN VRAM or memory issues occur THEN the system SHALL log resource usage and provide optimization suggestions
4. WHEN configuration errors exist THEN the system SHALL log configuration validation results and missing requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the generation system to validate my hardware capabilities and model availability before attempting generation, so that I receive early feedback about potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate model availability and hardware requirements
2. WHEN generation is requested THEN the system SHALL check VRAM availability against model requirements
3. IF hardware is insufficient THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative settings or model configurations
4. WHEN models are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide clear download or repair instructions
