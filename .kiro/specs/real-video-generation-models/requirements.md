# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the actual WAN video generation models to replace the current placeholder model references (`Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-Diffusers`, etc.) with functional WAN model implementations. The system has comprehensive infrastructure for model management, hardware optimization, and generation pipelines, but currently references non-functional placeholder models. This implementation will create the actual WAN T2V-A14B, I2V-A14B, and TI2V-5B models as the MVP foundation, leveraging all existing infrastructure including the ModelIntegrationBridge, RealGenerationPipeline, and hardware optimization systems. Future iterations will introduce additional model options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use actual working WAN video generation models instead of placeholder references, so that I can generate real videos using the WAN model architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL use functional WAN model implementations (T2V-A14B, I2V-A14B, TI2V-5B)
2. WHEN a T2V generation is requested THEN the system SHALL use the actual WAN T2V-A14B model implementation
3. WHEN an I2V generation is requested THEN the system SHALL use the actual WAN I2V-A14B model implementation
4. WHEN a TI2V generation is requested THEN the system SHALL use the actual WAN TI2V-5B model implementation
5. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about the actual WAN model being loaded

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically download and cache working models, so that I don't need to manually manage model files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is requested but not cached THEN the system SHALL download it from Hugging Face using the existing ModelDownloader infrastructure
2. WHEN downloading models THEN the system SHALL use the existing progress tracking and WebSocket notifications
3. WHEN models are downloaded THEN the system SHALL validate them using the existing ModelValidationRecovery system
4. WHEN model download fails THEN the system SHALL use the existing retry and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain compatibility with existing API endpoints and parameters, so that the React frontend continues to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new models are integrated THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to accept the same parameters
2. WHEN model types are specified (t2v-A14B, i2v-A14B, ti2v-5B) THEN the system SHALL map them to appropriate real models
3. WHEN generation parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL adapt them to work with the real model requirements
4. WHEN the system responds THEN it SHALL maintain the existing response format for frontend compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to leverage existing hardware optimization for real models, so that generation runs efficiently on my RTX 4080 and Threadripper PRO system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real models are loaded THEN the system SHALL apply existing RTX 4080 optimizations (VRAM management, tensor cores)
2. WHEN VRAM usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL use existing VRAMMonitor with real model memory requirements
3. WHEN hardware optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL use existing WAN22SystemOptimizer settings
4. WHEN models require more VRAM than available THEN the system SHALL use existing offloading and quantization strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide accurate progress tracking for real generation, so that I can monitor actual model inference progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real generation starts THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates based on actual model inference steps
2. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show realistic time estimates based on actual model performance
3. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL report actual generation time and resource usage
4. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL use existing WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle different model architectures gracefully, so that I can use various types of video generation models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different model architectures are used THEN the system SHALL adapt generation parameters appropriately
2. WHEN models have different input requirements THEN the system SHALL handle preprocessing automatically
3. WHEN models produce different output formats THEN the system SHALL standardize them to MP4 video files
4. WHEN model-specific optimizations are needed THEN the system SHALL apply them automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive error handling for real model issues, so that I get helpful guidance when problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about the actual model and suggest solutions
2. WHEN CUDA memory errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest model-specific optimization strategies
3. WHEN model inference fails THEN the system SHALL categorize the error and provide recovery suggestions
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative models or mock generation with clear notifications

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to be designed for future model expansion, so that additional models can be integrated after the WAN MVP is complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WAN models are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain a modular architecture for adding future models
2. WHEN model configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL support adding new model types without breaking existing functionality
3. WHEN the MVP is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear interfaces for integrating additional video generation models
4. WHEN future models are planned THEN the system SHALL document the integration process for non-WAN models

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain existing LoRA support with real models, so that I can customize generation style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LoRA files are specified THEN the system SHALL apply them to real models using existing LoRAManager
2. WHEN LoRA compatibility varies by model THEN the system SHALL handle compatibility checks automatically
3. WHEN LoRA loading fails THEN the system SHALL continue generation without LoRA and provide clear warnings
4. WHEN multiple LoRAs are used THEN the system SHALL handle them according to the real model's capabilities

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide model information and capabilities, so that I understand what each model can do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide information about their capabilities and limitations
2. WHEN model status is requested THEN the system SHALL report actual model health and performance metrics
3. WHEN generation parameters are set THEN the system SHALL validate them against real model requirements
4. WHEN models are compared THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on which model is best for specific use cases
