# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create component validation infrastructure

  - Create ComponentValidator class with validation methods
  - Implement component validation logic for Gradio components
  - Add validation reporting and logging capabilities
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Implement safe event handler system

  - Create SafeEventHandler class for robust event setup
  - Implement component filtering methods to remove None values
  - Add event handler validation before Gradio setup
  - Replace direct event handler assignments with safe wrappers
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Fix LoRA components event handlers

  - Validate all LoRA components before event setup
  - Replace direct .click() and .change() calls with safe event setup
  - Add None component filtering for LoRA event handlers
  - Implement fallback functionality when LoRA components fail
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Fix optimization components event handlers

  - Validate system_optimizer availability before creating events
  - Check optimization components exist before event setup
  - Use safe event handler setup for all optimization events
  - Skip optimization events gracefully when components are missing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Fix generation components event handlers

  - Ensure all generation components are valid before event setup
  - Replace model_type_outputs direct assignment with safe setup
  - Use safe_event_setup consistently for all generation events
  - Add comprehensive None component filtering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 6. Fix output components event handlers

  - Validate video gallery components before event setup
  - Handle missing output directory gracefully in event setup
  - Use safe event handler setup for all output management events
  - Provide alternative output management when components fail
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Enhance UI creation process with validation

  - Modify \_create_interface method to use component validation
  - Add component registration system for tracking
  - Implement creation reporting and error logging
  - Add validation checkpoints throughout UI creation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 8. Implement error recovery and fallbacks

  - Add component recreation logic for failed components
  - Implement UI fallback mechanisms for missing features
  - Create user-friendly error reporting system
  - Add automatic recovery suggestions and guidance
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Test and validate the fixes

  - Test UI startup with all components working
  - Test UI startup with some components missing
  - Verify all event handlers work correctly after fixes
  - Test error recovery and fallback mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive error handling
  - Add specific error handling for Gradio component failures
  - Implement detailed logging for component validation issues
  - Create user guidance for common component problems
  - Add system health checks before UI creation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
