# Generation Progress Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The generation progress was jumping from 40% to 100% without intermediate updates during the actual video generation process. Users couldn't see real-time progress during the most time-consuming part of the generation.

## Root Cause

The `_run_real_generation` method in `GenerationService` was calling `generate_video_with_optimization` without providing a progress callback to update the database during generation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Progress Callback to GenerationService

**File:** `backend/services/generation_service.py`

- Added a `progress_callback` function that:
  - Maps generation progress (0-100%) to task progress (40-95%)
  - Updates the database with `task.progress` and commits changes
  - Sends WebSocket notifications for real-time UI updates
  - Includes proper error handling

### 2. Updated RealGenerationPipeline to Accept External Callbacks

**File:** `backend/services/real_generation_pipeline.py`

- Modified `generate_video_with_optimization` to extract and pass `progress_callback`
- Updated `generate_t2v`, `generate_i2v`, and `generate_ti2v` methods to:
  - Accept external progress callbacks
  - Call both internal progress tracking AND external callbacks
  - Convert internal progress ranges to external progress ranges

### 3. Progress Mapping

- **0-40%**: Pre-generation steps (model loading, parameter setup)
- **40-95%**: Actual generation with real-time updates
- **95-100%**: Post-processing and completion

## Technical Details

### Progress Flow

1. **GenerationService** creates progress callback
2. **RealGenerationPipeline** receives and forwards callback
3. **Individual generation methods** call callback during generation
4. **Database** gets updated with each progress change
5. **WebSocket** sends real-time updates to frontend

### Error Handling

- Progress callback failures don't interrupt generation
- Warnings logged for debugging
- Graceful degradation if WebSocket unavailable

## Files Modified

1. `backend/services/generation_service.py` - Added progress callback
2. `backend/services/real_generation_pipeline.py` - Updated to use external callbacks
3. `fix_generation_progress_updates.py` - Fix script
4. `test_progress_updates_simple.py` - Test script

## Testing

Run the test script to verify progress updates:

```bash
python test_progress_updates_simple.py
```

Expected behavior:

- Progress should update smoothly from 40% to 95% during generation
- Multiple progress updates should be visible (not just 40% → 100%)
- WebSocket notifications should provide real-time updates

## Benefits

- ✅ Real-time progress visibility during generation
- ✅ Better user experience with accurate progress tracking
- ✅ Proper database updates for queue monitoring
- ✅ WebSocket integration for live UI updates
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Restart the backend server to apply changes
2. Test with actual generation requests
3. Monitor logs for progress callback execution
4. Verify frontend receives WebSocket progress updates
