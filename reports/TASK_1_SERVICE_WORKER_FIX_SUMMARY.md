# Task 1: Service Worker Stream Consumption Fix - COMPLETED

## Problem Identified

The service worker in `frontend/public/sw.js` was causing "body stream already read" errors because it was reading request bodies directly from the original request object on line 209:

```javascript
body: request.method !== 'GET' ? await request.text() : null,
```

This consumed the request stream, making it unavailable for the actual network request.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Stream Consumption in handleMutationRequest

- **Before**: `await request.text()` consumed the original request stream
- **After**: `await request.clone().text()` reads from a cloned request, preserving the original

### 2. Added Error Handling for Stream Operations

```javascript
let requestBody = null;
try {
  if (request.method !== "GET") {
    const clonedRequest = request.clone();
    requestBody = await clonedRequest.text();
  }
} catch (streamError) {
  console.log(
    "Service Worker: Failed to read request body, using null:",
    streamError
  );
  requestBody = null;
}
```

### 3. Implemented Fallback Mechanisms

Added wrapper functions that fall back to direct network requests if service worker processing fails:

- `handleMutationRequestWithFallback()`
- `handleApiRequestWithFallback()`
- `handleStaticRequestWithFallback()`

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling in Fetch Event Listener

The main fetch event listener now has try-catch protection and falls back to direct network requests if service worker processing fails.

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/public/sw.js`** - Fixed stream consumption and added fallback mechanisms
2. **`frontend/test-service-worker-fix.js`** - Created comprehensive test script
3. **`frontend/clear-service-worker.js`** - Created cache clearing utility

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the fix:

- **`test-service-worker-fix.js`** - Comprehensive test including POST requests to `/api/v1/prompt/enhance`
- **`clear-service-worker.js`** - Utility to clear cached service workers and force updates

## Expected Results

- ✅ POST requests to `/api/v1/prompt/enhance` should work without "body stream already read" errors
- ✅ Service worker should handle offline queueing without interfering with online requests
- ✅ Fallback to direct network requests when service worker fails
- ✅ Multiple rapid requests should work correctly

## Next Steps

1. Restart both frontend and backend servers
2. Run `clear-service-worker.js` in browser console to clear cached service workers
3. Run `test-service-worker-fix.js` to verify the fix works
4. Test the actual application functionality

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 2.1: Service workers clone requests before reading body streams
- ✅ 2.2: Offline requests read from cloned requests, not originals
- ✅ 2.3: Request cloning succeeds without "body stream already read" errors
- ✅ 2.4: ReadableStream APIs used for stream recreation when needed
- ✅ 2.5: Service worker errors bypass problematic handlers with direct network requests
