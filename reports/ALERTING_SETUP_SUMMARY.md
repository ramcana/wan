## Configuration Files

- **Alert Rules:** `config/alerting-config.yaml`
- **Logs Directory:** `logs/alerting/`
- **Dashboard:** `reports/alerting/alert_dashboard.html`
- **CLI Tool:** `scripts/manage_alerts.py`

## Usage

### Start Alerting System
```bash
python -m tools.health_checker.automated_alerting
```

### Manage Alerts
```bash
# List active alerts
python scripts/manage_alerts.py list

# Acknowledge an alert
python scripts/manage_alerts.py acknowledge critical_health_score --by "John Doe"

# Resolve an alert
python scripts/manage_alerts.py resolve critical_health_score --by "Jane Smith" --notes "Fixed configuration issue"

# Test alert system
python scripts/manage_alerts.py test critical_health_score
```

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for full functionality:

```bash
# Email notifications
export SMTP_USERNAME="your-email@company.com"
export SMTP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
export ALERT_FROM_EMAIL="alerts@company.com"

# Slack notifications
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."

# SMS notifications (optional)
export SMS_API_KEY="your-sms-api-key"

# GitHub integration (optional)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
```

## Alert Rules

The system includes the following default alert rules:

1. **Critical Health Score** - Triggers when overall health score < 70
2. **Emergency Health Score** - Triggers when overall health score < 50
3. **Test Failures** - Triggers on critical test failures
4. **Security Issues** - Triggers on high/critical security issues
5. **Performance Degradation** - Triggers on performance issues
6. **Configuration Errors** - Triggers on critical configuration issues

## Escalation Policies

- **Standard Escalation:** Slack → Email+Slack → Email+Slack+SMS
- **Emergency Escalation:** All channels immediately → Phone calls

## Notification Channels

- **Email:** SMTP-based email notifications
- **Slack:** Webhook-based Slack messages
- **SMS:** API-based SMS alerts (requires service setup)
- **Phone:** Voice call alerts (requires service setup)

## Monitoring

- Alert logs: `logs/alerting/`
- Acknowledgments: `logs/alerting/acknowledgments.jsonl`
- Resolutions: `logs/alerting/resolutions.jsonl`
- Dashboard: `reports/alerting/alert_dashboard.html`

## Next Steps

1. Configure notification channels by setting environment variables
2. Test the alerting system with mock alerts
3. Customize alert rules based on your specific needs
4. Set up integrations with external services (Jira, PagerDuty, etc.)
5. Train team members on alert management procedures
