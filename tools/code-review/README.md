# Generate refactoring suggestions
python -m tools.code-review.cli refactor --project-root .

# View technical debt

```

### Review a Single File

```bash
python -m tools.code-review.cli review --file src/main.py --format json
```

### Add Technical Debt Item

```bash
python -m tools.code-review.cli debt add \
  --file src/legacy_module.py \
  --title "Complex authentication logic needs refactoring" \
  --severity high \
  --category architecture \
  --effort 16
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Project dependencies installed
- Write access to project directory (for technical debt database)

### Configuration

The tools use a configuration file at `tools/code-review/config.json`. Key settings include:

```json
{
  "max_complexity": 10,
  "max_function_length": 50,
  "max_class_length": 200,
  "security_patterns": ["eval\\(", "exec\\("],
  "exclude_patterns": ["*/tests/*", "*/__pycache__/*"]
}
```

## Tool Components

### 1. Code Reviewer (`code_reviewer.py`)

Analyzes Python code for quality issues across multiple dimensions:

- **Complexity Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity calculation
- **Maintainability Checks**: Function length, documentation coverage
- **Performance Analysis**: Nested loops, inefficient patterns
- **Security Scanning**: Dangerous function calls, potential vulnerabilities

**Example Usage:**

```python
from tools.code_review.code_reviewer import CodeReviewer

reviewer = CodeReviewer(project_root=".")
issues = reviewer.review_file("src/main.py")
for issue in issues:
    print(f"{issue.severity.value}: {issue.message}")
```

### 2. Refactoring Engine (`refactoring_engine.py`)

Provides intelligent refactoring suggestions based on code analysis:

- **Extract Method**: Break down long or complex methods
- **Extract Class**: Split large classes with multiple responsibilities
- **Simplify Conditionals**: Reduce complex conditional logic
- **Improve Naming**: Suggest better variable and function names
- **Remove Duplication**: Identify and eliminate duplicate code

**Example Usage:**

```python
from tools.code_review.refactoring_engine import RefactoringEngine

engine = RefactoringEngine(project_root=".")
suggestions = engine.analyze_file("src/complex_module.py")
for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(f"Priority {suggestion.priority}: {suggestion.title}")
```

### 3. Technical Debt Tracker (`technical_debt_tracker.py`)

Comprehensive system for tracking and managing technical debt:

- **Debt Item Management**: Add, update, and track debt items
- **Priority Scoring**: Automatic calculation based on severity, category, age, and effort
- **Metrics and Analytics**: Comprehensive debt metrics and trend analysis
- **Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions for debt reduction

**Example Usage:**

```python
from tools.code_review.technical_debt_tracker import TechnicalDebtTracker

tracker = TechnicalDebtTracker()
metrics = tracker.calculate_debt_metrics()
print(f"Total debt items: {metrics.total_items}")
print(f"Total estimated hours: {metrics.total_estimated_hours}")
```

### 4. Command Line Interface (`cli.py`)

Unified CLI providing access to all functionality:

```bash
# Code review commands
python -m tools.code-review.cli review [OPTIONS]

# Refactoring commands
python -m tools.code-review.cli refactor [OPTIONS]

# Technical debt commands
python -m tools.code-review.cli debt [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS]

## Understanding Results

### Issue Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, system failures
- **HIGH**: Significant maintainability or performance issues
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate code quality impacts
- **LOW**: Minor style or documentation issues
- **INFO**: Informational suggestions

### Issue Categories

- **COMPLEXITY**: High cyclomatic complexity, deeply nested code
- **MAINTAINABILITY**: Long methods, missing documentation, poor naming
- **PERFORMANCE**: Inefficient algorithms, resource leaks
- **SECURITY**: Dangerous function calls, input validation issues
- **STYLE**: Formatting, naming conventions
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Missing or inadequate documentation
- **TESTING**: Test-related issues
- **ARCHITECTURE**: Structural and design issues

### Refactoring Priority Levels

- **Priority 1**: Critical refactoring needed (high complexity, major issues)
- **Priority 2**: Important improvements (moderate complexity, significant benefits)
- **Priority 3**: Recommended improvements (minor issues, good practices)
- **Priority 4**: Optional improvements (style, minor optimizations)

### Technical Debt Priority Scoring

Priority scores are calculated based on:

- **Severity Weight**: Critical (10), High (7), Medium (4), Low (1)
- **Category Weight**: Security (3x), Performance (2.5x), Architecture (2x)
- **Age Factor**: Older items get higher priority (up to 2x multiplier)
- **Effort Factor**: Reasonable effort items get priority bonus

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Analyzers

Extend the system with custom analysis rules:

```python
from tools.code_review.code_reviewer import CodeReviewer, CodeIssue
import ast

class CustomAnalyzer:
    def analyze(self, file_path: str, tree: ast.AST, content: str):
        # Custom analysis logic
        issues = []
        # ... analyze and create issues
        return issues

reviewer = CodeReviewer()
reviewer.custom_analyzer = CustomAnalyzer()
```

### Batch Processing

Process multiple projects:

```python
def batch_review(project_paths):
    results = {}
    for project_path in project_paths:
        reviewer = CodeReviewer(project_path)
        results[project_path] = reviewer.review_project()
    return results
```

### External Tool Integration

Export results for external tools:

```python
def export_to_sonarqube(issues, output_path):
    # Convert to SonarQube format
    sonar_issues = [convert_issue(issue) for issue in issues]
    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump({"issues": sonar_issues}, f)
```

## Configuration Options

### Code Review Settings

```json
{
  "max_complexity": 10,
  "max_function_length": 50,
  "max_class_length": 200,
  "min_documentation_coverage": 80
}
```

### Performance Settings

```json
{
  "performance_mode": true,
  "parallel_workers": 4,
  "cache_results": true,
  "max_file_size_mb": 1
}
```

### Security Patterns

```json
{
  "security_patterns": [
    "eval\\(",
    "exec\\(",
    "subprocess\\.call",
    "os\\.system"
  ]
}
```

### Exclusion Patterns

```json
{
  "exclude_patterns": [
    "*/migrations/*",
    "*/tests/fixtures/*",
    "*/vendor/*",
    "*/__pycache__/*"
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module not found errors**: Ensure you're running from the project root
2. **Database permission errors**: Check write permissions in project directory
3. **Performance issues**: Use file-specific reviews for large projects
4. **False positive warnings**: Configure exclusion patterns appropriately

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Performance Optimization

For large projects:

- Use file filtering and exclusion patterns
- Enable parallel processing
- Use incremental analysis in CI/CD
- Cache results for unchanged files
