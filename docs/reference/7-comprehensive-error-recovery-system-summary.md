# Task 7: Comprehensive Error Recovery System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive error recovery system for the WAN22 system optimization framework, addressing requirements 6.1-6.7 for robust error handling, automatic recovery, system state preservation, and user-guided recovery workflows.

## Implementation Details

### 7.1 ErrorRecoverySystem Class ✅

**File**: `error_recovery_system.py`

**Key Features Implemented**:

- **Error Handler Registration**: Dynamic registration of error handlers for specific exception types with customizable recovery strategies
- **Automatic Recovery Attempts**: Intelligent recovery with exponential backoff, retry limits, and strategy selection
- **System State Preservation**: Complete system state snapshots with JSON and pickle serialization for recovery
- **Recovery Strategies**: Multiple recovery approaches including immediate retry, exponential backoff, fallback configuration, state restoration, and safe shutdown
- **Thread Safety**: Thread-safe operations with proper locking mechanisms
- **Recovery Statistics**: Comprehensive tracking and reporting of recovery attempts and success rates

**Core Components**:

```python
class ErrorRecoverySystem:
    - register_error_handler()      # Register custom error handlers
    - attempt_recovery()            # Execute recovery attempts
    - save_system_state()          # Preserve system state
    - restore_system_state()       # Restore from saved state
    - get_recovery_statistics()    # Recovery metrics
    - cleanup_old_states()         # Maintenance operations
```

**Recovery Strategies Implemented**:

- `IMMEDIATE_RETRY`: Quick retry for transient errors
- `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF`: Progressive delay for connection issues
- `FALLBACK_CONFIG`: Safe configuration alternatives
- `STATE_RESTORATION`: Restore from known good state
- `USER_GUIDED`: Interactive problem resolution
- `SAFE_SHUTDOWN`: Emergency shutdown for critical errors

### 7.2 Logging and Recovery Workflows ✅

**File**: `recovery_workflows.py`

**Advanced Logging System**:

- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with comprehensive context
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic rotation with compression and cleanup
- **System State Capture**: Full system information including hardware, memory, GPU, and process details
- **Contextual Information**: Stack traces, user actions, recovery context, and system metrics
- **Multiple Log Levels**: Enhanced levels including RECOVERY and USER_ACTION

**Recovery Workflows**:

- **User-Guided Workflows**: Step-by-step recovery procedures for complex issues
- **Built-in Workflows**: Pre-configured workflows for VRAM detection and quantization timeout issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time workflow execution monitoring
- **Workflow Discovery**: Automatic workflow recommendation based on error patterns

**Key Components**:

```python
class AdvancedLogger:
    - log_with_context()           # Comprehensive contextual logging
    - log_recovery_attempt()       # Recovery-specific logging
    - log_user_action()           # User action audit trail

class RecoveryWorkflowManager:
    - start_workflow()            # Initiate guided recovery
    - complete_step()             # Progress through workflow steps
    - get_workflow_progress()     # Track completion status
    - find_applicable_workflows() # Auto-discover relevant workflows

class LogRotationManager:
    - Automatic log rotation with size limits
    - Compression of old log files
    - Cleanup based on age thresholds
```
