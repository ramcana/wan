# Codebase Cleanup and Organization Summary

## Completed: 2025-01-06

### 🎯 Objective Achieved

Successfully cleaned up and organized the entire WAN project codebase, transforming a cluttered root directory into a professional, maintainable structure.

## 📊 Cleanup Statistics

### Files Organized

- **147 files changed** in total
- **30+ documentation files** moved from root → `docs/archive/`
- **25+ test files** moved from root → `tests/archive/`
- **15+ utility scripts** moved from root → `scripts/utils/`
- **20+ report files** organized into `reports/` subdirectories
- **2 demo files** moved to `demo/examples/`

### New Structure Created

```
