# WAN Generation Service Update Summary

## Overview

Updated the Generation Service (`backend/services/generation_service.py`) to use real WAN models instead of simulation, implementing enhanced resource monitoring, optimization, and fallback strategies specifically designed for WAN model inference.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Real WAN Model Integration (Requirement 1.1, 4.1)

#### Enhanced `_run_real_generation` Method

- **Before**: Generic model loading with basic VRAM checks
- **After**: WAN model-specific validation, loading, and optimization
- **Key Features**:
  - WAN model availability and integrity validation
  - Hardware compatibility checking
  - Enhanced VRAM monitoring with WAN model-specific thresholds
  - WAN model-specific progress tracking and WebSocket notifications

#### WAN Model Validation

```python
# Validates WAN model status before generation
model_status = await self.model_integration_bridge.check_model_availability(model_type)
if model_status.status.value == "missing":
    # Handle missing model
elif model_status.status.value == "corrupted":
    # Handle corrupted model
elif not model_status.hardware_compatible:
    # Handle hardware incompatibility
```

### 2. WAN Model Resource Monitoring (Requirement 7.1)

#### Enhanced VRAM Monitoring

- **`_estimate_wan_model_vram_requirements()`**: Precise VRAM estimation for each WAN model type
  - T2V A14B: 10GB base requirement
  - I2V A14B: 11GB base requirement (includes image processing)
  - TI2V 5B: 6GB base requirement
  - Dynamic resolution-based scaling

#### VRAM Optimization Strategies

- **`_apply_wan_model_vram_optimizations()`**: WAN model-specific optimizations
  - Model offloading configuration
  - VAE tile size adjustment based on model type
  - Attention slicing enablement
  - Integration with WAN22SystemOptimizer

#### Critical VRAM Management

- **`_enable_wan_model_aggressive_optimization()`**: Emergency optimization when VRAM usage exceeds 90%
  - Sequential CPU offload
  - Minimal VAE tile sizes (128px)
  - FP16 precision enforcement
  - All available memory optimizations

### 3. WAN Model Optimization During Generation (Requirement 8.1)

#### Pre-Generation Optimization

- **`_apply_wan_model_pre_generation_optimizations()`**: Model-specific optimization profiles
  - CPU offload configuration
  - Optimal VAE tile size selection
  - Quantization level setting
  - Hardware-specific optimizations

#### Real-Time Monitoring

- Enhanced progress callbacks with WAN model metadata
- VRAM usage tracking during generation
- Performance metrics collection
- WebSocket notifications with WAN model context

### 4. WAN Model Fallback Strategies (Requirement 8.1)

#### Alternative Model Selection

- **`_get_alternative_wan_models()`**: Intelligent fallback model selection
  - Hardware-aware model prioritization
  - Capability-based alternatives (T2V → TI2V → I2V)
  - VRAM-based model selection (low VRAM → smaller models)

#### Fallback Hierarchy

1. **Primary WAN Model**: Requested model with full optimization
2. **Alternative WAN Models**: Compatible models with similar capabilities
3. **Mock Generation**: Only as final fallback when all WAN models fail

### 5. Enhanced Initialization and Configuration

#### WAN Model Verification

- **`_verify_wan_model_availability()`**: Startup verification of available WAN models
- Model status checking and availability reporting
- WebSocket notifications for missing models

#### Pipeline Configuration

- **`_configure_pipeline_for_wan_models()`**: WAN model-specific pipeline setup
- Hardware profile integration
- WAN model feature enablement
- Optimization parameter configuration

### 6. Generation Mode Updates

#### Priority Changes

```python
# Before
self.use_real_generation = True
self.fallback_to_simulation = True

# After
self.use_real_generation = True
self.fallback_to_simulation = False  # Disabled by default
self.prefer_wan_models = True        # Prefer WAN models
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### WAN Model VRAM Requirements

| Model Type | Base VRAM | With Resolution Scaling | Optimization Potential |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| T2V A14B   | 10GB      | 10-15GB (1080p+)        | 7-8GB (optimized)      |
| I2V A14B   | 11GB      | 11-16GB (1080p+)        | 8-9GB (optimized)      |
| TI2V 5B    | 6GB       | 6-9GB (1080p+)          | 4-5GB (optimized)      |

### Optimization Strategies by Hardware

| VRAM Available | Strategy    | Models Prioritized | Optimizations Applied       |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| < 8GB          | Aggressive  | TI2V 5B only       | All optimizations + offload |
| 8-12GB         | Balanced    | TI2V 5B → A14B     | Selective optimizations     |
| > 12GB         | Performance | A14B → TI2V 5B     | Minimal optimizations       |

### WebSocket Notification Types

- `wan_generation_started`: WAN model generation initiation
- `wan_generation_completed`: Successful completion with metrics
- `wan_generation_failed`: Failure with error context
