## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Generation Request → Analytics Tracking → Database Storage → Statistical Analysis → Recommendations
```

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Usage Events Table
model_usage_events (
    id, model_id, event_type, timestamp,
    duration_seconds, success, error_message,
    generation_params, performance_metrics
)

-- Aggregated Statistics Table
model_usage_stats (
    id, model_id, date, total_requests,
    successful_requests, failed_requests,
    total_generation_time, average_generation_time,
    peak_hour, unique_prompts
)
```

### Integration Points

1. **Generation Service**: Automatic event tracking hooks
2. **Model Availability Manager**: Usage-informed prioritization
3. **Enhanced Model Downloader**: Download event tracking
4. **Model Health Monitor**: Health check event tracking
5. **WebSocket Manager**: Real-time analytics updates

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- **In-Memory Cache**: 15-minute TTL for frequently accessed statistics
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic on new usage events
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries on model_id and timestamp

### Data Management

- **Aggregation**: Hourly rollup of detailed events into daily summaries
- **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of events older than 90 days
- **Compression**: JSON serialization for complex parameters

### Asynchronous Processing

- **Background Tasks**: Periodic aggregation and cleanup
- **Non-Blocking**: Analytics tracking doesn't impact generation performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on analytics failures

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage Tracking

```python
from core.model_usage_analytics import track_generation_usage, UsageEventType

# Track generation request
await track_generation_usage(
    model_id="t2v-A14B",
    event_type=UsageEventType.GENERATION_REQUEST,
    generation_params={"prompt": "test", "resolution": "1280x720"}
)

# Track completion
await track_generation_usage(
    model_id="t2v-A14B",
    event_type=UsageEventType.GENERATION_COMPLETE,
    duration_seconds=120.5,
    performance_metrics={"vram_usage_mb": 8200}
)
```

### Getting Analytics Data

```python
from services.generation_service_analytics_integration import (
    get_usage_statistics_for_model,
    get_cleanup_recommendations,
    get_preload_recommendations
)

# Get model statistics
stats = await get_usage_statistics_for_model("t2v-A14B")
print(f"Usage frequency: {stats['uses_per_day']:.2f} uses/day")

# Get recommendations
cleanup_recs = await get_cleanup_recommendations()
preload_recs = await get_preload_recommendations()
```

## Integration with Enhanced Model Availability System

### Model Availability Manager Integration

```python
# Usage analytics inform download prioritization
analytics = await get_model_usage_analytics()
for model_id in models:
    stats = await analytics.get_usage_statistics(model_id)
    if stats.usage_frequency > 1.0:
        priority = ModelPriority.HIGH
    elif stats.usage_frequency > 0.1:
        priority = ModelPriority.MEDIUM
    else:
        priority = ModelPriority.LOW
```

### Cleanup Integration

```python
# Automated cleanup based on analytics
cleanup_recs = await analytics.recommend_model_cleanup()
for rec in cleanup_recs:
    if rec.confidence_score > 0.8 and rec.priority == "high":
        # Safely remove unused model
        await model_manager.cleanup_model(rec.model_id)
```
