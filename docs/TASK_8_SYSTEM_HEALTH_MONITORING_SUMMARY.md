## Usage Examples

### Basic Health Monitoring

```python
from health_monitor import create_demo_health_monitor

with create_demo_health_monitor() as monitor:
    # Monitor runs automatically
    current_metrics = monitor.get_current_metrics()
    active_alerts = monitor.get_active_alerts()
```

### Dashboard with Protection

```python
from health_monitoring_dashboard import create_demo_dashboard
from critical_hardware_protection import create_demo_protection_system

monitor = create_demo_health_monitor()
dashboard = create_demo_dashboard(monitor)
protection = create_demo_protection_system(monitor)

# Start all systems
monitor.start_monitoring()
protection.start_protection()

# Generate comprehensive health report
reports = dashboard.generate_health_report()
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage
