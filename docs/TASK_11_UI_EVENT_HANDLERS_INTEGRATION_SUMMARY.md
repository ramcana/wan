## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. Import the enhanced event handlers: `from ui_event_handlers import get_event_handlers`
2. Initialize with configuration: `handlers = get_event_handlers(config)`
3. Register UI components: `handlers.register_components(components)`
4. Set up event handlers: `handlers.setup_all_event_handlers()`

### For UI Integration

The enhanced event handlers automatically integrate with the main UI through the existing integration points in `ui.py`. No additional configuration is required.
