# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### Q: What is the purpose of the cleanup and quality improvement tools?

**A:** These tools address critical issues in the WAN22 project:

- **Test Suite Reliability**: Fix broken and flaky tests
- **Configuration Management**: Consolidate scattered configuration files
- **Code Quality**: Enforce consistent coding standards
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain up-to-date documentation
- **Maintenance**: Automate routine cleanup and optimization tasks

### Q: How do I get started with the tools?

**A:** Follow these steps:

1. Complete the [Team Onboarding Guide](../onboarding/team-onboarding-guide.md)
2. Run the initial health check: `python tools/unified-cli/cli.py health-check`
3. Start with basic commands: `python tools/unified-cli/cli.py --help`
4. Practice with [Hands-on Exercises](../onboarding/hands-on-exercises.md)

### Q: Are the tools safe to use on production code?

**A:** Yes, with proper precautions:

- Tools create backups before making changes
- Use `--dry-run` mode to preview changes
- Start with `--safe-mode` for conservative operation
- Test changes in development environment first
- Use rollback capabilities if needed

## Tool-Specific Questions

### Test Management

#### Q: Why are my tests failing after running the test auditor?

**A:** The test auditor may have:

- Updated test fixtures to current standards
- Fixed import statements that were masking issues
- Improved test isolation, revealing hidden dependencies
- Updated test data to match current schemas

**Solution**: Review the audit report and update your tests accordingly.

#### Q: How do I handle flaky tests?

**A:** Use the flaky test detection system:

```bash
# Detect flaky tests
python tools/test-quality/cli.py detect-flaky --runs 10

# Get recommendations for fixing
python tools/test-quality/cli.py analyze-flaky --test-name your_test

# Quarantine consistently flaky tests
python tools/test-quality/cli.py quarantine --test-name your_test
```

#### Q: Can I exclude certain tests from auditing?

**A:** Yes, configure exclusions in `config/unified-config.yaml`:

```yaml
tools:
  test_auditor:
    exclude_patterns:
      - "tests/legacy/*"
      - "tests/experimental/*"
    exclude_tests:
      - "test_specific_function"
```

### Configuration Management

#### Q: Will configuration consolidation break my existing setup?

**A:** No, the migration process is designed to be safe:

- Original configurations are backed up
- Migration is performed incrementally
- Validation ensures no functionality is lost
- Rollback is available if issues occur

#### Q: How do I handle environment-specific configurations?

**A:** Use the environment override system:

```yaml
# config/unified-config.yaml (base configuration)
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432

# config/environments/production.yaml (production overrides)
database:
  host: prod-db.example.com
  ssl: true
```

#### Q: Can I keep some configurations separate?

**A:** Yes, you can:

- Mark configurations as "external" in the migration plan
- Use configuration includes for large external files
- Maintain separate configs for third-party tools
- Document exceptions in the configuration guide

### Code Quality

#### Q: The code quality checker is too strict. Can I adjust the rules?

**A:** Yes, customize quality standards:

```yaml
# config/unified-config.yaml
tools:
  code_quality:
    rules:
      line_length: 100 # Default is 88
      complexity_threshold: 15 # Default is 10
      documentation_required: false # For legacy code
```

#### Q: How do I handle legacy code that doesn't meet current standards?

**A:** Use progressive improvement:

- Set lower standards for legacy directories
- Use `# noqa` comments for specific violations
- Create improvement plans for gradual updates
- Focus on new code meeting full standards

#### Q: Can I integrate quality checks with my IDE?

**A:** Yes, see [IDE Integration Guide](../tools/ide-integration.md):

- VS Code extension available
- PyCharm plugin configuration
- Vim/Neovim integration
- Real-time feedback during development

### Documentation

#### Q: How often should I regenerate documentation?

**A:** Documentation generation frequency depends on your workflow:

- **Automatic**: Set up pre-commit hooks for critical docs
- **Daily**: For active development projects
- **Weekly**: For stable projects
- **On-demand**: Before releases or major changes

#### Q: Can I customize the documentation templates?

**A:** Yes, templates are customizable:

- Edit templates in `docs/templates/`
- Add custom sections and formatting
- Include project-specific information
- Maintain consistency across documents

#### Q: How do I handle documentation for external dependencies?

**A:** Use the external documentation system:

- Link to official documentation
- Create local summaries for key concepts
- Document integration-specific details
- Maintain version compatibility notes

## Performance Questions

### Q: The tools are running slowly. How can I improve performance?

**A:** Try these optimization strategies:

```bash
# Enable caching
python tools/unified-cli/cli.py config set caching.enabled true

# Use parallel execution
python tools/unified-cli/cli.py config set execution.parallel true

# Reduce scope for large projects
python tools/unified-cli/cli.py config set scope.max_files 1000

# Profile tool performance
python tools/unified-cli/cli.py profile --tool test-auditor
```

### Q: How much disk space do the tools require?

**A:** Space requirements vary by project size:

- **Small projects** (< 1000 files): ~100MB
- **Medium projects** (1000-10000 files): ~500MB
- **Large projects** (> 10000 files): ~2GB
- **Caches and backups**: Additional 20-50% of project size

### Q: Can I run tools on a subset of the project?

**A:** Yes, use scope limiting:

```bash
# Specific directories
python tools/unified-cli/cli.py --scope backend/,frontend/

# File patterns
python tools/unified-cli/cli.py --include "*.py,*.js"

# Exclude patterns
python tools/unified-cli/cli.py --exclude "tests/,docs/"
```
