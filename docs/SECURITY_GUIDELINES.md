# Security Guidelines for WAN2.2

## 🔒 Environment Variables and Secrets Management

### Critical Security Rules

1. **Never commit .env files to version control**

   - ✅ .env is in .gitignore
   - ✅ Use .env.example for templates

2. **API Token Security**

   - 🔄 Rotate tokens regularly (every 90 days)
   - 🎯 Use minimal required permissions
   - 🚫 Never share tokens in chat/logs/screenshots

3. **Local Development**
   - Keep .env files local only
   - Use different tokens for dev/staging/production
   - Never copy-paste tokens in public channels

### Token Management Checklist

- [ ] Hugging Face token has minimal required permissions
- [ ] Token is stored only in local .env file
- [ ] .env file is in .gitignore
- [ ] Token rotation schedule is established
- [ ] Team members use individual tokens

### Emergency Response

If a token is potentially exposed:

1. **Immediately revoke the token** at the provider
2. **Generate a new token** with minimal permissions
3. **Update local configuration** with new token
4. **Audit access logs** if available
5. **Document the incident** for future prevention

### Production Deployment

For production environments:

- Use environment variables or secrets management systems
- Never store secrets in configuration files
- Implement token rotation automation
- Monitor for unauthorized access

## 🛡️ Additional Security Measures

### Code Security

- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning in CI/CD
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure error handling (no sensitive data in logs)

### Infrastructure Security

- HTTPS only for all communications
- Proper CORS configuration
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Regular security audits
