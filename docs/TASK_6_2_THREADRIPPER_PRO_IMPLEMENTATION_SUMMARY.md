# Task 6.2: Threadripper PRO 5995WX Optimizations Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive Threadripper PRO 5995WX optimizations in the WAN22 system optimizer, focusing on multi-core CPU utilization, NUMA-aware memory allocation, and parallel processing configuration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Multi-Core CPU Utilization

**Features Implemented:**

- Optimal thread allocation for 64-core Threadripper PRO (32 threads for AI workloads)
- Inter-op parallelism configuration (16 preprocessing threads)
- CPU affinity management for optimal core utilization
- Environment variable optimization for multi-threading libraries

**Key Optimizations:**

```python
# PyTorch threading optimization
torch.set_num_threads(32)  # Optimal for AI workloads
torch.set_num_interop_threads(16)  # Preprocessing threads

# Environment variables for multi-threading
OMP_NUM_THREADS = 32
MKL_NUM_THREADS = 32
NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS = 32
TORCH_NUM_THREADS = 32
```

### 2. NUMA-Aware Memory Allocation

**Features Implemented:**

- NUMA node detection (automatic and fallback methods)
- Preferred NUMA node configuration
- Memory interleaving across NUMA nodes
- NUMA-aware environment variable setup

**NUMA Detection Methods:**

1. **Primary**: Python `numa` library (if available)
2. **Secondary**: System command parsing (`numactl --hardware`)
3. **Fallback**: Default 2-node configuration for Threadripper PRO

**NUMA Optimizations:**

```python
# NUMA memory allocation
numa.set_preferred_node(0)  # Primary node
numa.set_interleave_mask([0, 1])  # Interleave across nodes

# Environment variables
NUMA_PREFERRED_NODE = 0
NUMA_INTERLEAVE_NODES = 0,1
```

### 3. Parallel Processing Configuration

**Features Implemented:**

- Automatic worker count detection based on CPU cores
- Configurable parallel preprocessing workers (8 workers)
- Dedicated I/O workers (4 workers)
- Batch processing workers (2 workers)
- Multiprocessing optimization with spawn method

**Parallel Configuration:**

```python
parallel_config = {
    'preprocessing_workers': 8,      # Main preprocessing
    'io_workers': 4,                 # File I/O operations
    'batch_processing_workers': 2    # Batch operations
}
```

### 4. Hardware-Specific Settings

**Threadripper PRO Optimizations:**

- **Tile Size**: 512x512 (larger for powerful CPU preprocessing)
- **VAE Tile Size**: 384x384 (optimized for CPU support)
- **Batch Size**: 4 (higher with CPU support)
- **Memory Fraction**: 0.95 (higher with abundant CPU resources)
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Disabled (abundant CPU resources)
- **CPU Offloading**: Selective (keep critical components on GPU)
