# Task 2.3 Implementation Summary: I2V/TI2V Support and Queue Management

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive I2V/TI2V support and enhanced queue management functionality for the React Frontend with FastAPI Backend project. This implementation extends the generation endpoint to handle image uploads, adds robust file validation, and provides complete queue management capabilities with HTTP polling support.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Extended Generation Endpoint for I2V/TI2V Modes

**File:** `backend/api/routes/generation.py`

- **Enhanced image upload handling** for I2V and TI2V modes
- **Model-specific validation** ensuring T2V rejects images while I2V/TI2V require them
- **Comprehensive error handling** with user-friendly messages and suggestions
- **Integration with existing generation service** for background processing

### 2. Advanced Image Validation and Preprocessing

**Function:** `validate_and_process_image()` in `backend/api/routes/generation.py`

#### Supported Image Formats

- JPEG/JPG (`image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`)
- PNG (`image/png`)
- WebP (`image/webp`)
- BMP (`image/bmp`)
- TIFF (`image/tiff`)

#### Validation Features

- **File size validation**: Maximum 10MB per image
- **Dimension validation**: 64x64 to 4096x4096 pixels
- **Format validation**: Ensures valid image files using PIL
- **Content type verification**: Validates MIME types
- **Automatic format conversion**: RGBA→RGB, Palette→RGB for compatibility

#### Image Preprocessing

- **Safe filename generation**: Uses task ID to prevent conflicts
- **Quality optimization**: JPEG saved at 95% quality, PNG optimized
- **Secure file handling**: Images saved to `uploads/` directory with proper naming

### 3. Enhanced Queue Management

**File:** `backend/api/routes/queue.py`

#### Queue Status Endpoint (`GET /api/v1/queue`)

- **Comprehensive task listing** with optional filtering and limits
- **Status-based filtering** (pending, processing, completed, etc.)
- **Detailed task information** including progress, timestamps, and metadata
- **Accurate statistics** for all task statuses including cancelled tasks

#### Task Cancellation (`POST /api/v1/queue/{task_id}/cancel`)

- **Safe cancellation** of pending and processing tasks
- **Status validation** prevents cancellation of completed/failed tasks
- **Automatic timestamp updates** for completion tracking
- **Database persistence** ensures cancelled state survives restarts

#### Queue Cleanup Operations

- **Individual task deletion** (`DELETE /api/v1/queue/{task_id}`)
- **Bulk cleanup** (`POST /api/v1/queue/clear`) for completed tasks
- **File cleanup** automatically removes associated image and output files

### 4. HTTP Polling Support

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/queue/poll`

#### Optimized for 5-Second Polling

- **Lightweight responses** with only essential data
- **Active task filtering** (pending/processing only)
- **Bandwidth optimization** with truncated prompts and minimal data
- **Real-time statistics** for pending and processing counts
- **Timestamp tracking** for client synchronization

#### Response Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "pending_count": 2,
  "processing_count": 1,
  "active_tasks": [...],
  "has_active_tasks": true
}
```

### 5. Background Task Processing

**File:** `backend/services/generation_service.py`

#### Enhanced Processing Features

- **Image-aware generation** handles I2V/TI2V with uploaded images
- **Progress tracking** with real-time database updates
- **Error categorization** provides specific feedback for VRAM, model, and timeout issues
- **Graceful failure handling** with detailed error messages

#### Task Lifecycle Management

- **Automatic status transitions**: pending → processing → completed/failed
- **Progress updates**: 0% → 100% with intermediate milestones
- **Timestamp tracking**: creation, start, and completion times
- **Output path management**: automatic file path assignment

### 6. Queue Persistence Testing

**Files:**

- `backend/test_queue_persistence.py`
- `backend/test_queue_simple.py`
- `backend/test_task_2_3_validation.py`

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage

- **Database persistence** verification across restarts
- **Task state preservation** for all status types
- **Image upload persistence** with file path tracking
- **Cancellation persistence** ensuring cancelled tasks remain cancelled
- **Queue statistics accuracy** validation

#### Test Results

- ✅ **Queue persistence after restart**: All tasks retained with correct status
- ✅ **Task cancellation persistence**: Cancelled tasks remain cancelled
- ✅ **Image upload persistence**: File paths and metadata preserved
- ✅ **Background processing**: Progress updates work correctly
- ✅ **HTTP polling**: Optimized responses for frequent requests

## Database Schema Updates

**File:** `backend/models/schemas.py`

### Enhanced QueueStatus Model

```python
class QueueStatus(BaseModel):
    total_tasks: int
    pending_tasks: int
    processing_tasks: int
    completed_tasks: int
    failed_tasks: int
    cancelled_tasks: int = 0  # New field
    tasks: List[TaskInfo]
```

### Task Status Enumeration

- `PENDING`: Task created, waiting for processing
- `PROCESSING`: Task currently being generated
- `COMPLETED`: Task finished successfully
- `FAILED`: Task failed with error
- `CANCELLED`: Task cancelled by user (persistent)
